## Unicorns

*version 0427*

Normand is standing just outside the upstairs sewing room, about to knock on the door, which is closed. There's a paper sign stuck to it with masking tape. The masking tape looks like it's been recycled from some other project - it's all torn up and bent out of shape. The sign, which is on lined paper and written in red marker, says, "Gone Curling. Go away."

Normand's Niece has always been one of the more complicated women in his life. He has exactly three. He has several minutes before Claudette arrives - he's brought a a van load of groceries for Maeve - not because she needs any at the moment, but because he needed an excuse to have to drive the minivan over the causeway. He knew Claudette would insist on getting out and walking the causeway. This gave him precious minutes to apologize to his niece before he would have to do it in front of Claudette.

Normand isn't a big fan of messing up in front of people. He knows he's not perfect, he'd just rather make his mistakes when nobody is around to remind him he made one. He knows damn well already.

"Maeve." Normand says, flatly. "Hey, Maeve." He knocks once. The room is small - his niece is ten feet away on the other side, under a blanket, on a cot. He knows this. Depending on her mood, she might have dragged the sewing table in front of the door. That would not stop Normand from opening it, if he had to, but he doesn't. He's going to be polite, and give her space. "Maeve. It's Normand. You in there?"

Of course Maeve is in there. Of course she's not going to say anything, or open the door, and pat him on the shoulder, and let him know they're all good. She fell off a ladder. She could have been hurt. She was hurt. It could have been worse. Once Normand got over being angry about Maeve not remembering their agreement to wait until the weekend to fix the roof together... well, he had remembered that his niece is his niece. She remembers what she wants to. That part has never changed.

"Maeve. Come on. Claudette's going to be here any minute. I have to say something before she gets here. Lemme in."

No response.

"Maeve."

Nothing.

"Maeve. Maevis. Maevis Morgan. Niece Maeve."

Nothing.

"I brought you pie. Apple pie. You like pie, if I remember." This is rhetorical, Maeve is a fan of every kind of food. Normand can usually get Maeve to do things by bringing her food. She and Bee had a lot in common.

Norm hears a squeak of cot springs. He raps on the door again.

There's a muffled voice from the other side of the door. Norm frowns and puts his ear to it. "What was that?"

The muffled voice gets a little louder. It sounds like, "Go away. Leave the pie."

"Come on, Maeve. I'm here to apologize. You know I suck at that. Don't make me stand out here. Claudette's probably half way across the causeway already. You know I don't talk right when she's close by and mad at me. You know that."

Maeve sounds like she's under three or four blankets. She's being really dramatic this time. "I don't want to see anybody, I'm curling. Go away." there's a short pause, then, "thanks for the pie."

Normand rubs his face in his big hand, and thumps his forehead on the door. "Maeve. Look. I'm sorry I got mad at you. I was a jerk."

"I know." says the muffled voice.

"I should have helped you get the ladder set up."

"It's a really huge ladder."

"I know, I know. Look, I was going to help you with that. I didn't think you'd try re-shingling the roof without me. We're supposed to fix that stuff together, remember? Remember what Bee said? We have to fix the house together. We're a team." Norm isn't sure if bringing up Bee right now is a good idea. Too late.

No response.

"Maeve?"

Long pause. "My foot's fine, thanks for asking."

*Oh, for...* Normand doesn't know how he gets himself into these things. Why did he just tell *Maeve* she was supposed to wait for him? Why didn't he tell Claudette too? Then Claudette would have told him that it wasn't a good idea to expect Maeve to remember anything when she's upset. Maeve has been upset for months.

Claudette always knows when Normand's decisions aren't going to be the right ones. Without Claudette, every decision Norm makes is just a coin toss.

Norm takes a breath. "Maeve. C'mon. Let me come in and say I'm sorry. I just want to say I'm sorry. And make sure your foot's OK."

"My foot's fine. I want my pie now."

Norm hears claudette coming up the front porch. "*Mon Dieu.*" he mutters to himself, and trundles down the hall and down the stairs. He left the food in the van. He doesn't even try making conversation with Claudette as she comes in - they won't be on proper speaking terms for another twenty-four to forty-eight hours, by his reckoning. He just keeps his eyes downcast as she breezes past him, pie already in hand, and heads up stairs, where she already knows Maevis has gone curling.

---

There's a knock on the sewing room door, and Claudette says through it, "Maevis, honey, I brought you pie - it's apple. Do you want it heated?"

Maeve is curled up inside a thick, old blanket that smells like her Aunt Bee, and she isn't sure she wants her apple pie heated. It's a big decision and she doesn't feel up to making it right now. She's thinking though.

"Maeve, can I come in? I can't fit the pie under the door."

Maeve's foot really hurts. She doesn't want to make a big deal about that right now, but it really does. It's swollen and huge and it's still throbbing and the brace itches too. When she first fell and her ankle went sort of sideways, she had gone down like a sack of potatoes, and then the old ladder had fallen on her, like it was trying to finish her off, and her foot felt all warm right away and it wasn't until later it really started to hurt. That was when she finally found her phone and called Normand and yelled at him and then he started yelling back and she remembered that she had forgotten their deal to shingle the roof together on the weekend, and she knew she wouldn't be able to get the shingles on the roof in time for Liz's visit and her whole plan to tell Liz something scary and important, that she had been working on for the last two weeks, was all going out the window.

And then she could hear Claudette in the background asking Normand what was going on and then they were arguing and it was all because she used masking tape to fix the ladder, because she had lost the air pump somewhere, and the wheelbarrow had had a flat since last year, and she had just forgotten to do too many things in a row this time. And now Claudette and Normand were mad at each other.

And Maeve really wants the pie under the blanket with her, but she wants it warmed up and she wants Claudette to stay out in the hall while she eats it and feels sorry for herself. How can she tell Claudette all of that? She doesn't feel like talking right now. Everybody is mad at her.

"Go away" is what Maeve says. She hopes Claudette doesn't go away. She wants to be alone but she doesn't.

"Maevis, honey" Claudette's says through the sewing room door, "I'm sorry we weren't there to help you with the roof. I'm sorry you fell - you gave us a big scare. We were so worried that you... I'm so glad you didn't break something. I know it hurts."

Maeve curls up more, winding the blanket up all around her. It's stuffy all wound up in the blanket, but she can't help it. Nobody's going to hug her right now and she needs Bee's blanket to hug her. "My foot's fine. I don't care about my foot."

"Maeve, Normand brought some groceries, he's putting them in the pantry and fridge. He went a bit nuts. He feels bad. Not just because I'm mad at him. He loves you. We both love you."

Maeve thinks a moment, and mumbles, "Everybody's mad at me."

"What's that, Maeve? I can't hear you."

"Everybody's mad at me."

"Maeve, no, what do you mean? Nobody's mad at you." The door clicks as Claudette lets herself in. Maeve wishes she had dragged the sewing table in front of the door. But then, she wants Claudette to come in and tell her that nobody's mad at her. "Go away."

"Maeve, sweetie pie -"

"I want to be alone. Everybody's mad at me". Maeve hears Normand coming up the porch, it sounds like he's carrying a hundred grocery bags. She hopes he brought Ketchup chips.

Claudette lets herself into the little sewing room, leaves the door a bit open, and pulls up a chair, next to the cot where the balled-up blanket containing her Niece is laying. "Maeve, nobody's mad at you. Why do you think that? We were worried sick you were seriously hurt. I'm sorry you heard Normand and I arguing. That's what we do, you know, when he does something stupid." She gives the blanket-ball a playful poke. "It happens a lot, right?"

Maeve isn't in the mood. Her best friend in the entire world might never speak to her again. She shouldn't have told Liz about not-kissing Peotr. "Everybody is mad at me."

Claudette's puts a hand on the blanket-ball. "Nobody's mad at you Maeve. We're here. You're fine. things will be alright. What can I get you?"

But things won't be alright, Maeve doesn't see how they could be. Everything has gone sideways.

"Eat your pie, we're going to stay the night. Normand's going to get the shingles done tomorrow. You and I can eat ice cream all day tomorrow. I brought some tapes. We'll get out the VHS and we'll watch Fraggle Rock and nobody will say anything. I promise."

"I want to be alone", mumbles Maeve, but she knows Claudette's not going anywhere.

Maeve pokes her hand out of the blanket and finds Claudette's hand and she holds it for a bit and then Claudette hands her a plate with a big piece of apple pie, and a fork, and Maeve hears Claudette get up and leave, and the sewing room door shut lightly.

Downstairs, the sounds of Normand and Claudette talking in low voices calms Maeve down. Normand isn't mad at her, she knows that. He never stays mad at her for long, and even when he is, he's always half-assed about it. He's not that good at being really mad. And Claudette never gets mad at Maeve. Maeve wouldn't even know what that would feel like.

So why does it feel like everybody is mad at her? Only one person is mad at Maeve. That person just feels like everybody to her right now, that's all.

*Years before...*

Maeve Morgan sits at her desk and tries not to notice that the desk is in the exact centre of the room. The classroom has 5 columns of desks and 7 rows. There are thirty-five desks in the room - plus the one for the teacher, at the front - and Maeve Morgan has joined the class in the middle of the year, and they have put her in the desk that is exactly in the middle of the room. It is in column 3, row 4.

It's 5 minutes before the start of the class, and most of the other kids have come in and almost all of them have spent some time staring at Maeve and almost all of them have said something to somebody else about the new kid, wondering out loud where she came from and none of them know how to talk quietly, so Maeve hears everything, and it is just not OK.

Maeve isn't apt to make friends today. Maybe not this year. Maybe Ani will take her out of school before the end of the year, like she often does, but Maeve is probably in for a few months of being the New Kid anyway. Why did it have to be the *middle* desk? Why did she have to draw the *middle* desk, right in the middle of *middle* school? She doesn't like being in the middle. Her mother Ani has terrible, terrible timing. And bad aim too.

Somebody has carved the words "pee pee" on her desk, using a knife or protractor. There's an illustration to go with it. Inappropriate. Maybe she can just stare at the words "pee pee" all day. No, that probably won't help.

"Hey," some kid next to her says. "Hey, kid. Hey."

Maeve feels her face redden. She doesn't look up. There is a small crowd of kids all looking at her and exchanging theories about where she came from, and wondering if anybody knows where she lives, and if she can talk. Maybe she can't talk, one of them wonders. Maeve just holds onto her new desk, and imagines it's a rocket-powered desk, and maybe it will launch her out of here any minute.

"Hey, kid. What, can you hear me? Mitch, *shut up!*" The kid yells something to Mitch, who has said something about Maeve, maybe. Maeve isn't sure if she is going to be able to hold on to the desk hard enough, for long enough. She feels like she might fall backward, and tumble to the back of the room, because it feels like it's titling up. Why did some kid need to carve "pee pee" on her desk? Did they know she was going to have to sit here?

"Hey, kid."

Maeve has a way of rocking back and forth when she needs things to stop moving. It's like things are already moving, and when she manages to rock back and forth at the same speed as everything else, then everything will stop moving again.

"What's she doing?"

"She's going to blow up."

"Shut up. She's got special needs."

"Shh, they can hear you, stop talking. They can hear you."

"Look at her, she's going to blow up. Look out."

"Shut *up*."

"Hey kid."

There's a rushing sound and Maeve's hands hurt because she's holding on to the desk pretty hard. She forgot her watch. She isn't sure how many more minutes this class is going to be. It hasn't started yet. She's in the middle of the room. Row 4, Column 3.

Her eyes are closed. She's holding her breath.

"Hi, I'm Liz." a small voice says. "I'm going to sit here, today. I need to see the board. Denny, switch, OK?"

Maeve doesn't know where that voice came from. Her eyes are closed tight. She isn't sure who Liz is. Who's Denny?

"Is that OK? I usually sit back there but I don't have my glasses, so I'm going to sit here, next to you. I can't see the board without my glasses. Is that OK? I won't bother you."

A desk scrapes against the floor and then Maeve's desk has another desk next to it, and Maeve moves her hand so whoever Liz is can put the desks together, and then they're together.

That first period, Liz's voice answers every question Maeve is asked, so Maeve can just look at the words "pee pee" and wonder why somebody would write that, and then why would they draw it, and did they use a knife, or a protractor? Liz has a kind voice. She is good at math.

The day goes like that. There are lots of kids calling Maeve *kid* and there are lots of questions and she has to make things stop moving, but Liz is always somewhere close by, and Maeve doesn't know what Liz looks like, she just imagines what Liz looks like, by listening to her voice. She imagines a unicorn, who is really good at math, but can't see very well without her glasses. Maeve never thought that unicorns might need to wear glasses. 

Ani doesn't make Maevis go back to school after that first day, in the middle of November, because Maeve is good at hanging onto the door jam, and Ani has small wrists and has to get to work or she might be fired, so Maeve hangs out in the kitchen at the restaurant that week, until Ani can figure out what to do next. Ani always figured out what to do next.
