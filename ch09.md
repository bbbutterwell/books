## Unicorns

*version 0427*

Normand is standing just outside the upstairs sewing room, about to knock on the door, which is closed. There's a paper sign stuck to it with masking tape. The masking tape looks like it's been recycled from some other project - it's all torn up and bent out of shape. The sign, which is on lined paper and written in red marker, says, "Gone Curling. Go away."

Normand's Niece has always been one of the more complicated women in his life. He has exactly three of those. He has several minutes before the other two arrive - he's brought a a van load of groceries for Maeve - not because she needs any at the moment, but because he needed an excuse to have to drive the minivan over the causeway. He knew Claudette would insist that she and Olivia get out and walk the causeway. This gave him important minutes to apologize to his niece before he would have to do it in front of Claudette.

Normand isn't a big fan of messing up in front of people. He knows he's not perfect, he'd just rather make his mistakes when nobody is around to remind him he made one. He knows damn well already about the mistake.

"Maeve." Normand says, flatly. "Hey, Maeve." He knocks once. The room is small - his niece is ten feet away on the other side, under a blanket, on a cot. He knows this. Depending on her mood, she might have dragged the sewing table in front of the door. That would not stop Normand from opening it of course, if he had to, but he's not going to do that. The Curling Room is a protected habitat. A person doesn't go in without permission. "Maeve. It's Normand. You in there?"

Of course Maeve is in there, and of course she knows it's him. Of course she's not going to say anything, or open the door, and just pat him on the shoulder, and let him know they're all good. She fell off a ladder. Because of him. Not really, but. She could have been hurt. She *was* hurt. It could have a lot worse. Normand saw a guy die once, and another guy end up permanently enable to work, both from falling off things, in his time Out West and Up North. He had laid awake all night wondering what their world would be like if Maevis had fallen off the roof the wrong way.

She had told him she would wait until the weekend. But getting mad at Maeve for not remembering instructions is like getting mad at a cloud for having to go behind a hill. She remembers what her wind tells her to. 

"Maeve. Come on. Claudette's going to be here any minute. I have to say something before she gets here. Lemme in."

No response.

"Maeve."

Nothing.

"Maeve. Maevis. Maevis Morgan. Niece Maeve."

Nothing.

"I brought you pie. Apple pie. You like pie, if I remember. Or am I wrong?" This is rhetorical, Maeve is a fan of every kind of pie. Normand can usually get Maeve to do things by bringing her pie, or most any other kind of junk food. She and Bee had a lot in common.

Norm hears a squeak of cot springs. He raps on the door again.

There's a muffled voice from the other side of the door. Norm frowns and puts his ear to it. "What was that?"

The muffled voice gets a little louder. It sounds like, "Go away. Leave the pie."

"Come on, Maeve. I'm here to apologize. You know I suck at that. Don't make me stand out here. Claudette's probably half way across the causeway already, and Olivia's in a mood. You know I don't talk right when she's close by and mad at me. You know that."

Maeve sounds like she's under three or four blankets. "I don't want to see anybody, I'm curling. Go away." there's a short pause, then, "thanks for the pie. Say hi to Oliv for me."

Normand rubs his face in his big hand, and thumps his forehead on the door. "Maeve. Look. I'm sorry I got mad at you. I was a jerk."

"I know that." says the muffled voice.

"I should have helped you get the ladder set up."

"It's a really huge ladder, Norm."

"I know, I know. Look, I was going to help you with that. I didn't think you'd try re-shingling the roof without me. We're supposed to fix that stuff together, remember? Remember what Bee said? We have to fix these things together. We're a team." Norm isn't sure if bringing up Bee right now is a good idea. Too late.

No response.

"Maeve?"

Long pause. "My foot's fine, thanks for asking."

Normand doesn't know how he gets himself into these things. Why did he just tell *Maeve* she was supposed to wait for him till the weekend? Why didn't he tell Claudette too? Then Claudette would have told him that it wasn't a good idea to ask Maeve to remember anything when she's upset. Maeve has been upset for months.

Claudette always knows when Normand's decisions aren't going to be the right ones. Without Claudette, every decision Norm makes is just a coin toss. That's what Norm thinks.

Norm takes a breath. "Maeve. C'mon. Let me come in and say I'm sorry. I just want to say I'm sorry. And make sure your foot's OK."

"My foot's fine. I want my pie now."

Norm hears claudette coming up the front porch. "*Mon Dieu.*" he mutters to himself, and trundles down the hall and down the stairs. He left the food in the van. He doesn't even try making conversation with Claudette as she comes in - they won't be on proper speaking terms for another twenty-four to forty-eight hours, by his reckoning. He just keeps his eyes downcast as she breezes past him, pie already in hand, and heads up stairs, where she already knows Maevis has Gone Curling.

---

There's a knock on the sewing room door, and Claudette says through it, "Maevis, honey, I brought you pie - it's apple. Do you want it heated? There's ice cream too, and cheddar cheese."

Maeve is curled up inside a thick, old blanket that smells like her Aunt Bee, and she isn't sure she wants her apple pie heated, but she's glad there's cheese in the house again. It's a big decision about the heating of the pie, and she doesn't feel up to making any decisions right now. She's thinking though.

"Maevis, can I come in? I can't fit the pie under the door."

Maeve's foot really hurts. She doesn't want to make a big deal about that right now, but it really does. It's swollen and huge and it's still throbbing and the brace itches too. 

When she first fell two days ago, and her ankle went sort of sideways, she had gone down like a sack of potatoes, and then the old ladder had fallen on her, like it was trying to finish her off. In that moment, it was like the World had decided to attack her. Everything wasn't where it should be, and her old ladder, in its death throes, had tried to take her with it. After all they'd been through. 

She just lay there on the ground wondering if she had just broken her leg, getting angry at the World for attacking her that week, and her foot felt all warm right away and it wasn't until later that it really started to hurt, when she had finally found her phone and called Normand and yelled at him and then he started yelling back and she remembered that she had forgotten their deal to shingle the roof together on the weekend, and she knew she wouldn't be able to get the shingles on the roof in time for Liz's visit now, and her whole plan to tell Liz something scary and important, that she had been working on for the last two weeks, was all ruined.

And then she could hear Claudette in the background asking Normand what was going on and then they were arguing and it was all because Maeve used masking tape to fix the ladder, because the wheelbarrow had had a flat since last year, and she had lost the air pump somewhere, and she had just forgotten to do too many things in a row this time. And now Claudette and Normand were mad at each other, because she had maybe broken her leg. She hobbled around all day yesterday trying not to think about how Liz was mad at her now. She just couldn't have Liz join the rest of the World being mad at her, for forgetting to do something she should have done. 

She should have told Liz that Peotr almost kissed her, back when it had almost happened.She had just wanted that whole part to go away, like it never almost happened.

And now Maeve really wants the pie under the blanket with her, but she does want it warmed up and she wants Claudette to stay out in the hall while she eats it and feels sorry for herself. How can she tell Claudette all of that? She doesn't feel like talking right now. Everybody is mad at her.

"Go away" Maeve says. She hopes Claudette doesn't go away. She wants to be alone but she doesn't.

"Maevis, honey" says Claudette's kindest voice, through the sewing room door, "I'm so, so sorry we weren't there to help you with the roof. I'm sorry you fell - you gave us a big scare. We were so worried that you... I'm so glad you didn't break something. I know it hurts."

Maeve curls up more, winding the blanket up all around her. It's stuffy all wound up in the blanket, but she can't help it. Nobody's going to hug her right now and she needs Bee's blanket to hug her. Claudette is taking to her like she's a kid. Maeve hates that, most of the time. "My foot's fine. I don't care about my foot. I'm fine."

"Maeve, Normand brought some groceries, he's putting them in the pantry and fridge. He went a bit nuts. He feels bad. Not just because I'm mad at him. He loves you. We both love you."

"I know that." Maeve says, a bit testy now. Claudette's laying it on a little thick. Maeve thinks a moment, and mumbles, "Everybody's mad at me."

"What's that, Maeve? I can't hear you."

"Everybody's *mad* at me."

"Maeve, no, what do you mean? Nobody's mad at you. I'm coming in, alright?" After a pause, the door clicks and Maeve hears Claudette let herself in. Maeve sort of wishes she had dragged the sewing table in front of the door, so Claudette would have to get Normand to move it. But then, she wants Claudette to come in and tell her that nobody's mad at her. She doesn't want to talk to Normand. "Go away."

"Maeve, sweetie pie -"

"I want to be alone. Everybody's mad at me". Maeve hears Normand coming up the front porch outside, it sounds like he's carrying a hundred grocery bags. She hopes he brought Ketchup chips.

Claudette lets herself into the sewing room, leaves the door a bit open, and pulls up a chair, next to the cot where the balled-up blanket containing her Niece is laying. "Maeve, nobody's mad at you. Why do you think that? We were just worried sick you were seriously hurt. I'm sorry you heard Normand and I arguing. That's what we do, you know, when he does something stupid." She gives the blanket-ball a playful poke. "It happens a lot, right?"

Maeve isn't in the mood. Her best friend in the entire world might never speak to her again. She shouldn't have told Liz about not-kissing Peotr. "Everybody is mad at me."

Claudette's puts a hand on the blanket-ball. "Nobody's mad at you Maeve. We're here. You're fine. things will be alright. What can I get you?"

But things won't be alright, Maeve doesn't see how they could be. Everything went sideways. Her foot did, her friendship did... even the ladder didn't fall right. Physics was a jerk this week.

"Eat your pie, we're going to stay the weekend. Olivia's here, she's brought her homework. Normand's going to get the shingles done tomorrow, and you and I can eat ice cream all day. I brought some tapes. We'll get out the VHS and we'll watch Fraggle Rock and nobody will say anything. I promise."

"I want to be alone", mumbles Maeve, but she knows Claudette's not going anywhere.

Maeve pokes her hand out of the blanket and finds Claudette's hand and she holds it for a bit and then Claudette hands her a plate with a big piece of apple pie, and a fork, and Maeve hears Claudette get up and leave, and the sewing room door shut lightly.

Downstairs, the sounds of Normand and Claudette talking in low voices calms Maeve down. Normand isn't mad at her, she knows that. He never stays mad at her for long, and even when he is, he's always half-assed about it.  And Claudette never gets mad at Maeve. Maeve wouldn't even know what that would feel like. Olivia's always mad at everybody and everything since she turned eleven, so Maeve doesn't take that personally, she remembers what it's like to be eleven, going on thirteen. 

So why does it feel like everybody is mad at her? Only one person is mad at Maeve Morgan. That person just feels like everybody to her right now, that's all.

---

*Years before...*

Maeve Morgan sits at her desk and tries not to notice that the desk is in the exact centre of the room. The classroom has 5 columns of desks and 7 rows. There are thirty-five desks in the room - plus the one for the teacher, at the front - and Maeve Morgan has joined the class in the middle of the year, and they have put her in the desk that is exactly in the middle of the room. It is in column 3, row 4.

It's 5 minutes before the start of the class, and most of the other kids have come in and almost all of them have spent some time gawking at Maeve and almost all of them have said something to her, or to somebody else about the new kid, wondering out loud where she came from and none of them know how to talk quietly, so Maeve hears everything, and it is just not OK. They should reserve a corner desk in the back for kids whose parents enrol them in school a month-and-a-half late.

Maeve isn't apt to make friends today. Maybe not this year. Maybe Ani will take her out of school before the end of the year, like she often does, but Maeve is probably in for a few months of being the New Kid, no matter what. Why did it have to be the *middle* desk? Why did she have to draw the *middle* desk, right in the middle of *middle* school? She doesn't like being in the middle. Her mother Ani has terrible, terrible timing. And bad aim too.

Somebody has carved the words "pee pee!" on her desk, using a knife or protractor. There's an illustration to go with it. Inappropriate. Maybe she can just stare at the words "pee pee!" all day. No, that probably won't help.

"Hey," some kid next to her says. "Hey, you, kid. Hey."

Maeve feels her face redden. She doesn't look up. There is a small crowd of kids all looking at her from their desks and from standing positions and exchanging theories about where she came from, and wondering if anybody knows where she lives, and if she can talk. Maybe she can't talk, one of the kids wonders. Maeve just holds onto her new desk, and imagines it's a rocket-powered desk, and maybe it will launch her out of here any minute.

"Hey, kid. What, can you hear me? Mitch, *shut up!*" The kid hisses something to Mitch, who has said something about Maeve, that she didn't hear. Maeve isn't sure if she is going to be able to hold on to the desk hard enough, for long enough. She feels like she might fall backward, and tumble to the back of the room, because it feels like it's titling up. Why did some kid need to carve "pee pee!" on her desk? Did they know she was going to have to sit here, and stare at that?

"Hey, you. What's your name?"

Sometimes when everything seems to be moving on its own, Maeve finds rocking back and forth a little helps things to stop moving. It's like things are already moving, and when she manages to rock back and forth at the same speed as everything else, then everything will stop moving again. She's learned to do this only a little bit, and not a whole lot.

"What's she doing?"

"She's going to blow up."

"Shut *up*. She's got special needs."

"*Shh*, they can hear you, stop talking. They can still hear you you know."

"Look at her, she's going to blow up. Look outttt...."

"*Shut*. *Up*."

"Hey kid..."

There's a rushing sound and Maeve's hands hurt because she's holding on to the desk pretty hard now. She forgot her watch, she forgot her watch. She doesn't know how many more minutes this class is going to be. It hasn't started yet. She's in the middle of the room. Row 4, Column 3.

Her eyes are closed. She's holding her breath. Ani told her to close her eyes and breathe. But she's holding her breath. She forgot the instructions.

"Hi, I'm Liz." a clear voice says. "I'm going to sit here, today. I need to see the board, and I lost my glasses. Denny, switch, OK?"

Maeve doesn't know where the voice came from. To her left. Her eyes are closed tight. She isn't sure who Liz is. She doesn't know who Denny is.

"Is that alright? I usually sit back there but I lost my glasses somewhere, so I'm going to sit here, next to you. I can't see the board without my glasses. Is that OK? I won't bother you."

A desk scrapes against the floor and then Maeve opens on eye and sees another desk scooching next to hers, and the desk politely waits while Maeve moves her hand so whoever Liz is can put the desks completely together, and then they're together.

That first period, Liz's voice answers every question Maeve is asked, so Maeve can just look at the words "pee pee!" and wonder why somebody would write that, and then why would they draw it too, and did they use a knife, or a protractor? Liz has a kind, clear voice. She is good at math.

The day goes like that. There are lots of kids calling Maeve *kid* and there are lots of questions and she has to make things stop moving, but Liz's voice is always right there, the whole day, and Maeve doesn't know what Liz looks like, because she keeps her eyes closed or looking down the whole time, and she just imagines what Liz looks like, by listening to her voice. 

She imagines a knight in shining armour, who is really good at math, but forgot her glasses somewhere. Maeve never thought that knights might need to wear glasses. Nobody told her that.

That day is the longest day Maeve will ever spend in school. There will be some pretty long ones, but that one will be the longest she'll ever remember. Sir Liz follows her around all day, and even on to her bus, and sits next to her and shields her from every question, and tells her when they're at her stop, and Maeve doesn't even know how Liz knows all of that. She just does. And then Sir Liz says she'll see Maeve tomorrow in class, and Maeve already knows that's not true, but she will always think of Liz as the best kind of knight - one who has a shield but never needs a sword, because her voice is stronger than steel.   

Ani doesn't make Maevis go back to school after that first day, in the middle of November, because Maeve is good at hanging onto the door jam, and Ani has small wrists and has to get to work or she might be fired, so Maeve hangs out in the kitchen at the restaurant that week, until Ani can figure out what to do next. Ani always figured out what to do next.

---

It's Sunday morning and Normand got the wrong type of tacks for the roofing shingles, and I guess there was some kind of paper you're supposed to put down und them too, so he and Claudette argued some more and now it's Sunday and the stores are closed, because a lot of stores in Elders Falls still do that old-timey thing, so people don't have to feel like they need to go to work every damn day of their life. 

Claudette got mad at Normand because he waited until Sunday to put the shingles up and now the stores are closed, and they both have to get back to work tomorrow. Norm spent all Saturday trying to figure out where all the bird noises were coming from up there on the roof and I said I didn't know, the birds were just up there somewhere, so he got kind of grumpy and told me I can't just let birds move into the roof, they were going to poop all over the place and ruin everything. 

What am I going to do about birds living in the house? I'm not pest control professional. Besides, they had a right to be there. Some of those birds' families had been living on the island and in the sheds for longer than I've been alive. But not in the house, Normand said. The house is off limits to critters. But he knows that's not true. It's always been a stalemate between the people and the critters, in Bee's old house.

Anyway, that was Saturday. Norm would put the Giant Ladder against soe part of the house and go up there and hear some birds, and start stomping around trying to figure out where they were hanging out, and then he'd stomp back down and come in to get some water and he'd ask me how long the birds had been living in the roof or the soffits or the attic or wherever he thought they were, and I'd shrug and admit I had no idea. Claudette and I were busy watching all the Fraggle Rock seasons on VHS. I didn't want to be bothered with worried about birds. Then Normand would grumble and go back outside and move the Giant Ladder to some other part of the house and stomp around up there and find more birds and come back down and tell me I had a serious bird problem, and I just wanted to watch Fraggle Rock and not talk about anything. Eventually, Claudette told Normad he wasn't allowed to come in and tell us about any new birds he'd found.

That was Saturday. I saw just Olivia once, really quickly, when they first got here, when she skulked into the kitchen to grab enough food to keep herself fed for the rest of the weekend. She was hermitting pretty hard in the upstairs second guest room all Friday night and yesterday. That's the little one with the cool window sill that looks over the old chicken coop. That used to be my favourite room to hermit in too. I get it.

Now it's Sunday morning and Claudette and Normand can't figure out where Olivia went. She's not in her room anymore. That doesn't surprise me, because they got into a big fight about school or something last night and she started yelling and they started telling her, that's enough, young lady, and that really got her going and she just stormed upstairs and slammed her door twice, and wouldn't come out. Claudette and Normand decided to just let her simmer, and they'd talk it over in the morning. I guess that was a good plan.

Now Oliv's not in her room. We looked all over the house, and then I heard the back porch screen door close, like she was trying to be sneaky about it... by the time I hobbled over to the porch, I saw her disappear into the treeline on the other side of the Gnome garden. Oliv's never done *that* before.  Right into the trees. She's growing up. Growing sideways, maybe... I'm not sure what to call that. I get it though. I get that too. 

I told Norm and Claudette she was loose on the Island, and they acted like they hadn't even considered that would happen. What the hell. It's a big island, and Olivia is eleven and she's been mad at everybody for a whole year, so what did they expect? 

Normand and Claudette both took off into the trees in different directions, and I headed up to the Widow's Watch and watched the causeway, using my backpacking telescope, which is my medium-sized one, just in case my cousin decided to hoof it back to the mainland road herself, and maybe try something dumb like hitchhiking. But I didn't see anybody else come or go on the causeway, and then the tide was up after about an hour and a half, and I knew Olivia would stay on the island, because she's terrified of the rowboat. I don't blame her. We should really retire that thing.

Normand and Claudette were starting to freak out a bit. But not like their daughter had run into the actual woods. We all know the island well enough. I know it best. But Normand knows almost all the places on it that I do. Claudette knows most of the obvious places. 

I'm not sure yet how much of the island Oliv knows. She's only eleven. She's grown up knowing Sisters Island, but she hasn't been brave until more recently. Eleven-year old Oliv is already twice as brave as ten-year-old Oliv was. I notice these things. People don't think I do, but I definitely do. I know all about how brave people can be. That's one of my favourite things about people, to notice how brave they are, when they ned to be. 

Claudette and Normand both have jobs, and Oliv has after-school programs to keep her busy while they get done their jobs. When Oliv was younger, Normand was home all day because he was a stay-at-home Dad, and that was just fine with everybody. But then he needed to get back to work when Oliv got older, and I wasn't living on the Island yet full-time, and Bee wasn't up to taking care of any more young kids who weren't hers. Not that it mattered whose they were - I just mean, she's paid her dues, kid-wise, and was getting older. I was in an apartment when Oliv was growing up, and I had shift work and some school and so Oliv started going to after-school programs in town.

Anyway that's a lot of backstory. I'm just trying to explain why Normand and Claudette were worried. Oliv had never run away before, and the Island was safe, but it was also in the ocean, so it was only so safe. And Claudette had a flight to catch that next day, for work, and Normand had to be at work because half the staff had called in sick. They couldn't just hang out all Monday looking for Oliv.

This wasn't a big deal to me, I told them to go home, I would find Oliv. I know all the hiding spots on Sisters Island. There isn't one I haven't found already. Oliv's pretty smart, but she's not Island-savvy like I am. I will find her. That's what I said.  No problems.

Normand and Claudette said how am I going to find Oliv with my foot all messed up? I told them I had painkillers and that expensive crutch they had just brought me. I would be fine. Claudette and Normand both know me pretty well. They know what I've had to sometimes do. Sometimes they forget, but then, when the chips are down, they always remember. I might need to Go Curling now and then, but I'm still pretty tough when I need to be. I would find their grumpy little daughter, and get her back in one piece. Damn straight. Normand said he'd be back the next day right after work, but I said she'd be home by lunchtime. That's what I thought.
