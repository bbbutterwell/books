## Olives & Blueberries

*version 0429*

It's Sunday morning and Normand got the wrong type of tacks for the roofing shingles, and I guess there was some kind of paper you're supposed to put down under them too, so he and Claudette argued some more and now it's Sunday and the stores are closed, because a lot of stores in Elders Falls still do that old-timey thing, so people who work retail don't have to feel like they need to go to work every damn day of their life.

Claudette got mad at Normand because he waited until Sunday to put the shingles up, and now the stores are closed, and they both have to get back to work tomorrow. I think they're worried I'll try shingling the roof while I have a foot brace on, which is just not likely. Norm spent all Saturday trying to figure out where all the bird noises were coming from up there on the roof and I said I didn't know, the birds were just up there somewhere, so he got kind of grumpy and told me I can't just let birds move into the roof, they were going to poop all over the place and ruin everything. He didn't say poop, but I'm not going to say shit. This is my story. Just this once. It's kind of funny.

What am I going to do about birds living in the house anyway? I'm not a pest control professional. Besides, they have a right to be there too. Some of those birds' families have been living on the island and in the sheds for longer than I've been alive. But not in the house, Normand said. The house is off limits to critters. But he knows that's not true. It's always only been a stalemate between the people and the critters, on Sisters Island.

Anyway, that was Saturday, yesterday. Norm would go and put the Giant Ladder against some part of the house and go up there and hear some birds, and start stomping around trying to figure out where they were hanging out, and then he'd stomp back down and come in to get some water and he'd ask me how long the birds had been living in the roof or the soffits or the attic or wherever he thought they were, and I'd shrug and say I had no idea. Claudette and I were busy watching all the Fraggle Rock seasons on VHS and eating pie and ice cream and cheddar cheese, which was the plan, and I wasn't deviating. I didn't want to be bothered with worrying about birds and where they were living in the house. 

Then Normand would grumble and go back outside and move the Giant Ladder to some other part of the house and stomp around up there and find more birds and come back down and tell me I had a serious bird problem, but I just wanted to watch Fraggle Rock with Claudette and not talk about anything. Eventually, Claudette told Normad he wasn't allowed to come in and tell us about any new birds he'd found anywhere.

That was Saturday, yesterday. I saw just Olivia once this whole visit, really quickly, when they all first got here, when she skulked into the kitchen real quick to grab enough food to keep herself fed for the rest of the weekend in her room. She was hermitting pretty hard in the upstairs second guest room all Friday night and yesterday. That's the little one with the cool windowed overhang that looks over the old chicken coop. That used to be my favourite room to hermit in too. I get it.

Now it's Sunday morning and Claudette and Normand can't figure out where Olivia went. She's not in her room anymore. That doesn't surprise me, because they got into a big fight about school or something last night and she started yelling and they started telling her, that's enough, young lady, and that really got her going and she just stormed upstairs and slammed her door twice, and wouldn't come out. She's also mad we have no Internet here and the data coverage is terrible. Claudette and Normand decided to just let her simmer, and they'd talk it over in the morning. I guess that was a good plan. I don't like Internet that much. When I need it, there's always the library.

Now Oliv's not in her room. We looked all over the house, and then I heard the back porch screen door close, like she was trying to be sneaky about getting out... by the time I hobbled over to the porch, I saw her disappear into the tree line on the other side of the Gnome garden. Oliv's never done that before. Right into the trees. That kid's growing up fast. Growing sideways, maybe... I'm not sure what to call that. I get it though. I get that too. Last year, she was still scared of bushes, because she found out there were bees on somewhere on the island. Now she's just charging into the trees like nobody's business.

I told Norm and Claudette their kid was loose on the Island, and they acted like they hadn't even considered that would happen. What the hell. It's a big island, and Olivia is eleven and she's been mad at everybody for a whole year, so what did they expect? Of course she'd eventually bolt.

Norm and Claudette both took off into the trees in different directions, and I headed up to the Widow's Watch and watched the causeway, using my backpacking telescope, which is my medium-sized one, just in case my cousin decided to hoof it back to the mainland road herself, and maybe try something dumb like hitchhiking. But I didn't see anybody else come or go on the causeway, and then the tide was up after about an hour and a half, and I knew Olivia would stay on the island, because she's terrified of the rowboat. I don't blame her. We should really retire that thing. I went back downstairs once I knew Oliv was on the island. I know all the hiding places.

Normand and Claudette were starting to freak out a bit. But not like their daughter had run into the actual woods. We all know the island well enough. I know it best. But Normand knows almost all the places on it that I do. Claudette knows most of the obvious places. Still, we're on the ocean. We had to find her.

I'm not sure yet how much of the island Oliv knows. She's only eleven. She's grown up knowing Sisters Island, but she hasn't been brave until just today. Eleven-year old Oliv is already twice as brave as ten-year-old Oliv was. I notice these things. People don't think I do, but I definitely do. I know all about how brave people can be. That's one of my favourite things about people - how brave they are, when they decide to be. I'm trying to learn that too.

Sometimes I really miss Dooley. Dooley would have found Oliv in about six-and-a-half seconds. He didn't always look like he knew what he was doing, but he always did know what he was doing, when it mattered. He saved my life twice, maybe three times. Pretty average for an above-average dog like Dooley. Lots of good dogs save people's lives. They don't care if we notice, they just want scritches and bacon and to know we love them. Anyway, I still stop sometimes in the middle of what I'm doing, and think about Dooley. It still happens. I might get another dog someday soon. Just for child safety.

I told Claudette one of them should go down to the dock and hang out there just to make sure Oliv wouldn't try using the boat or maybe wading across the causeway, which I know she'd never do. You don't know what the causeway's like, once the water starts to go over it. You might think it would be calm but it's the ocean, so it's not fun. I didn't really have to finish explaining, Norm was off down the driveway toward the dock. I told Claudette to stay around the house in case Oliv came back, but to also check the henhouse and the Old New Shed, which is the shed that's closest to the house.

Claudette told me I shouldn't go hiking around on my bad foot, but I had the fancy crutch she brought me and I had taken my pain killers and now that I had a mission, I didn't feel quite so bad really. You know how they say when a kid's in danger, like trapped under a car or something, how a mom can get super strong? Well I'm only Oliv's cousin but I'm old enough to be her aunt so I think I had a kind of aunt strength and that's why my leg didn't really give me much trouble, once she took off. That's Science again.

I told Claudette look, I know all the hiding spots on the island. There isn't one I haven't found already. Oliv's pretty smart, but she's not Island-savvy like I am. I'll find her. That's what I said, and I meant it.

I went into the tree line where I saw Oliv go - on the other side of the Gnome garden, which I'll tell you more about later, and headed for the New Old Shed, which was a few hundred yards away, toward the orchard. I just had a hunch. 

I should mention about the sheds. There are four sheds on Sisters Island. There's the Old Old Shed, the Old New Shed, the New Old Shed, and the New New Shed. Everybody just calls that last one the Shed, even though it's further from the house than the Old New Shed. Don't ask me, I don't know why either.

All of these sheds were built by Bee's ex-husband, whose name was Bently. That's what she told me anyway. Ani and Norm swear he was her ex-husband but I don't know about that. Pretty mysterious guy, I still think they all made up the part about him and Bee being married. Who cares anyway? Anyway, that's apparently who built all the sheds on the island. 

The Old Old Shed is the oldest one, and it's pretty old. Almost collapsed. It's halfway across the island. I slept in it once but it's kind of creepy and I get weird vibes around it so I kind of just leave it alone. I was pretty sure Oliv wouldn't go that far, and even if she did, I know she'd never hide in the Old Old shed. It's not one of those sheds you just see and go, hey, look at that creepy old shed in the middle of the woods, I wonder why anybody would build an old shed in the woods? I think I'll go inside because I'm eleven years old and all alone. No, that's not a thing I was thinking was happening any time soon.

The Old New shed was what Bently built closest to the house, after he got tired of trekking way out into the woods to build whatever he built in the Old Old shed. We keep all the lawn stuff in there, and extra chicken feed. We currently don't have any chickens. The last six we had all escaped and most probably got eaten but every now and then I catch site of the crazy one, running around like it owns the whole island. I leave chicken feed out for it, so it doesn't go hungry. I guess it prefers being a wild chicken.

The New Old Shed is a few hundred yards from the house - not as far as the Old Old shed, but pretty far - and in the direction of the orchard. Bently built that one after Bee and he had their big fight, and he missed having a shed that was further away from the house, that he could actually get to in the Winter. He hadn't really thought about Winter when he picked where to put the Old Old shed - but now he had two sheds under his belt, so he knew more about planning sheds, so he built the New Old shed. It's the coziest. You can see the Ocean from its wee front porch. It has a little balcony on the top. It's like somebody took a decent little house and shrunk it down to one-third scale. Today they might call that a tiny home, but it's still really just a shed. That's the shed Oliv had run in the direction of, and that was the one I ran toward too, when I first decided to run away, right around the time I first stayed with Bee. I was Oliv's age, almost exactly. I was thinking about this while I was hiking toward the New Old Shed.

Just to finish the shed story, the fourth one is the New New Shed, or just the Shed. It's at the edge of the property, near where Norm likes to park his truck or minivan or hatchback or whatever he's currently driving, whenever he decides to visit. That shed's where all the car-related things go, and also is where the workshop is. It's pretty functional, as sheds go. Sometimes I think of it more as a garage, but bently always called his sheds sheds, so I'm not going to mess with that tradition.  

I think I'll tell you more about the sheds later. I'm getting off topic. I've found a lot of stuff in those sheds and had a few adventures in them and I just realized I could write a whole book about just that first Summer when I came to stay with Bee, and I'm just going to leave those stories for later. I'm telling you about my cousin right now, and what she's going through.

[PRESENT TENSE THIS!]

The morning's blue sky is vivid strips through the shade of the trees, where they give way at the top of the wide, old orchard, which rolls and spreads away, gently downhill, from that tree line, and toward the Bay. Right where the woods meet the fields, Bently's New Old Shed sits, squat and cozy, its front porch big enough for only two to sit. There's a bucket for catching water. There was once a door, but who needed that anymore? I became a worktable around the side, and inside, a bed frame where an air mattress could go, and a small cast-iron stove and a counter and some shelves and a desk and what else did a person need? Maybe a book. Maeve came out of the trees and took a look at the orchard sprawling down toward the sea, and she did not see her cousin, and she came around the side of the shed and Olivia wasn't sitting on the stoop, looking like a gloomy Gus, and Maevis went into the shed and looked around twice and said, "Huh." Olivia wasn't where Maeve thought she'd be.

It was a big island. Maeve knew all the hiding spots - that's what she thought - but it was still a big island. Her foot was sore, but it didn't matter - she had a mission. She called Olivia's name, twice, three times.  She came back down the steps, and sat for a bit. There was a good breeze coming up from the Bay, she could see past the bigger, old trees of the orchard, big swaths of water. The boats were out - several fishing, one or two just sailing about, as they do. Further out, to the left, the Settlement on the Arm, and beyond that, the lighthouse at the Bay's Neck. Across the bay, on her right, the docks in the town of Elders Falls. Most of the town was further to her right - hidden by the tree line at the edge of the orchard. That whole quarter of the island - the one facing the town across the bay most directly - was all rough rocks and weird crags and little holes and hollows and gulleys and funny small cliffs and even a marsh bit or two, and the most twisted, wind-dried tangled trees, and all those old bees. That was the part of the island where Maevis was sure the Gnomes must roam, when they strayed a bit further from her home.

Olivia wouldn't have gone that far though, she was pretty sure. Maybe she was already back at the house again, getting an earful from Claudette. Maeve didn't want to go in the wrong direction, and spend the day looking in the wrong place. Dooley would have found Olivia by now, easy-peasy. Maeve wasn't worried. It was a big island, but she wasn't worried. Something told her Oliv wasn't far. So she stood up, turned left, and followed the tree line at the top edge of the orchard, to get a good view of the whole field from a changing angle, in case the kid had decided to hide behind one of the apple trees. She wanted Oliv to be able to see her too, and so Maeve stayed out of the tree line, and in the sun.
