## Olives & Blueberries

*version 0430*

It's Sunday morning and Normand got the wrong type of tacks for the roofing shingles, and I guess there was some kind of paper you're supposed to put down under them too, so he and Claudette argued some more because now it's Sunday and the stores are closed, because the stores in Elders Falls still do that old-timey thing of not opening on Sunday, so people who work retail don't have to feel like they need to work every damn day of their life.

Claudette got mad at Normand because he waited until Sunday to put the shingles up, and now the stores are closed, and they both have to get back to work tomorrow. I think they're worried I'll try shingling the roof while I have a foot brace on, which is not really likely. 

Norm only got to trying to shingle today because he ended up spending all yesterday trying to figure out where all the bird noises were coming from up there on the roof and I said I didn't know, the birds were just up there somewhere, sometimes, so he got kind of mad and told me I can't just let birds move into the roof, they were going to poop all over the place and ruin everything. He didn't say poop, but you get what I mean. I'm not a big fan of some words. Inappropriate.

What am I going to do about birds living in the house anyway? I'm not a pest control service. Besides, they have a right to be here too. Some of those birds' families have been on the island for longer than I've been alive. But not in the house, Normand says, the house isn't for critters. But he knows that's not true. It's always been a stalemate between the folks and the critters, on Sisters Island.

Anyway, that was Saturday, yesterday. Norm would go and put the Giant Ladder against some part of the house and go up there and hear some birds, and start stomping around trying to figure out where they were hanging out, and then he'd stomp back down and come in to get some pop or lemonade or a flashlight, and he'd ask me how long the birds had been living in the roof or the soffits or the attic or wherever he thought they were, and I'd shrug and say I really didn't know. Claudette and I were busy watching all the Fraggle Rock seasons on VHS and eating pie and ice cream and cheddar cheese - which was the plan, and I wasn't deviating. I didn't want to be bothered with worrying where all the birds were right now.

Then Normand would grumble and go back outside and move the Giant Ladder to some other part of the house and stomp around up there and find more birds and come back down and tell me I had a serious bird problem. But I just wanted to watch Fraggle Rock with Claudette and not talk about anything, really. Eventually Claudette told Norm he wasn't allowed to come in and tell us about any new birds he'd found anywhere. So he spent the next couple more hours after that stomping around all over the place up there and grumbling to himself so we could hear, and we all knew he was still finding birds everywhere, anyway.

That was yesterday, Saturday. I had seen Olivia just once that whole visit, really quickly, when they all first got here on Friday, when she skulked into the kitchen real quick to grab enough food to keep herself fed for the rest of the weekend , without coming out. 

She was hermit-ing pretty hard in the upstairs small guest room all Friday night and yesterday. That's the little one with the cool windowed overhang that looks down on the old chicken coop. That used to be my favourite room to hermit in too. I get it.

Now it's Sunday morning and Claudette and Normand can't figure out where Olivia is. She's not in her room anymore. That doesn't surprise me, because they got into a big fight about school or something last night and she started yelling and they started telling her, that's enough, young lady, and that really got her going and she just stomped upstairs and slammed her door twice, and wouldn't come out, and they said fine, no dinner then, but she already had her food stocked up so I don't think that really won them anything. 

Olive's also mad that we have no Internet here on the Island and the data coverage usually doesn't work. Claudette and Norm decided to just let her be, and they'd talk about it later. I guess that was a good plan. I don't like Internet that much, I'll be honest, except for some things. When I need it, I go to the Elders Library, in town. I need reasons to go there to be around folks sometimes so that's a pretty good reason. I have to go there soon to see if Arthur got that email I sent last week. 

Now Oliv's not in her room. We looked all over the house, and then I heard the back porch door, like she was trying to be sneaky about getting out... by the time I had hobbled over, I saw her out in the backyard, way over by the trees, on the other side of the Gnome garden. She fled into the tree line. Oliv's never done that before. Right into the trees, no pausing. I'm not sure what to call that. I get it though. Last year, Olivia was still scared of bushes, because I told her there were gobs of bees somewhere on the island. I couldn't remember where. She wouldn't go near a bush for a while. 

I told Norm and Claudette their kid was loose, and they acted like they hadn't even thought that could happen. What the hell. It's a big island, and Olivia is eleven now and she's been mad at everybody for a whole year, so what did they expect? Of course she'd eventually bolt.

Norm and Claudette both took off into the trees in different directions, and I headed up to the widow's watch and scanned the causeway, using my backpacking telescope, which is my medium one, in case Oliv decided to hoof it back to the mainland road herself, and try something dumb like hitchhiking or walking along the road. But I didn't see anybody else come or go on the causeway, and then the tide was up about fifty minutes later, and I knew Olivia would stay on the island, because she's terrified of the rowboat. I don't blame her. We should retire that thing. I went back downstairs once I knew Oliv was on the island. I know all the hiding places. I'd find her.

Normand and Claudette were back and starting to freak out a bit by then - but not like their daughter had run into the actual woods. We all know the island well enough. I know it best. But Normand knows almost all the places on it that I do. Claudette knows most of the obvious places. Still, we're on the ocean. We had to find her before dark. I figured she'd come back on her own, but you never know.

I'm not sure yet how much of the island Oliv knows. She's only eleven, but eleven-year old Oliv is already twice as brave as ten-year-old Oliv was. I have been watching her get braver. I notice these things. People don't think I do, but I definitely do. I know all about how brave people are. That's one of my favourite things about them - how brave they are, when they decide. I'm trying to learn that. Some days I'm getting better.

Some days I remember how much I really miss Dooley. Dooley would have found Oliv in six-and-a-half seconds, or maybe ten. He didn't always look like he knew what he was doing, but he always knew what he was doing, when it mattered. He saved my life two or maybe three times. Pretty average for an un-average dog like Dooley. Lots of good dogs save people's lives. They don't care much if we notice, they just want scritches and treats and to know that we love them. 

I still stop sometimes in the middle of what I'm doing, and think about Dooley, and what he's up to, wherever he is now. It still happens. I might get another dog someday soon. For child safety reasons.

I told Claudette one of them should go down to the dock and hang out there just to make sure Oliv wouldn't try using the boat or maybe wading across the causeway, which I'm pretty sure she'd never do, because that would be dumb, but you just never know, with kids. You might not know what the causeway's like. You might think it would ever be calm enough for it to be safe to cross, ever -  but it's the ocean, so it's never really fun. The waves crash against it even sometimes on calm days., when you don't think there's going to be a wave in sight. It will happen sometimes, that the wind will pick up suddenly, and there's a moment when where you're standing won't be where the water won't be, two minutes from then. You think you're safe, and then you're not. You were wrong. This isn't just what our causeway is like, on Sisters Island - this is what it's like, almost everywhere it meets the water, all around it. There are places on Sisters Island where I will go without any emergency gear, on a nice or even not-great day. And then there's places I will never go. Most, it's a small gamble that can be made really small, by just knowing when the tides were coming in, and when they were going out. 

I haven't told you about the teeth that ring my island, and all its sides, save one - the teeth that come and go, with the rising and the falling of the sea. When the ocean surrounds you, knowing what is coming and what is going - and from where - this is what keeps you alive a little longer - long enough to learn the lessons which the island will teach you, as long as it doesn't take you. You have to be able to slow dance with the sea. And the sea always leads that dance - your job is to be a better partner, by knowing what and when  and how to follow.

But above all, you must always be brave and true.

even at low tide you can get drenched if the wind's a certain way, and you're standing in the wrong spot. That's why Norm's a madman for ever driving across it. He's careful about what days he does it, and he has his limits. 

Anyway, I didn't really have to finish explaining about somebody needing to guard the dock, Norm was off down the driveway as soon as I started saying it. I told Claudette to stay around the house in case Oliv came back, but to also check the henhouse and the Old New Shed, which is the shed that's closest to the house. I was going to go search the island and find her. I know all the hiding spots.

Claudette told me I shouldn't go hiking around on my bad foot, but I had the fancy crutch she brought me and I had taken my pain killers and now that I had a mission, I didn't feel quite so bad really. You know how they say when a kid's in danger, like trapped under a car or something, how a mom can get super strong? Well I'm only Oliv's cousin but I'm old enough to be her aunt so I think I had a kind of aunt strength and that's why my leg didn't really give me much trouble, once she took off. That's Science again.

I told Claudette look, I know all the hiding spots on the island. There isn't one I haven't found already. Oliv's pretty smart, but she's not Island-savvy like I am. I'll find her. That's what I said, and I meant it. Claudette said OK, and I hobbled into the backyard, and past the Gnome Garden, where I've had the most Gnome sightings, but not recently.

I went into the tree line where I had seen Oliv go, and then I headed through the woods for the New Old Shed, which was a few hundred yards away, over the ridge and toward the orchard. 

I guess I should mention about the sheds, I don't know. Maybe it will be useful lore, later on. There are four sheds on Sisters Island. There's the *Old* Old Shed, the Old *New* Shed, the New *Old* Shed, and the *New* New Shed (or the New *New* Shed, depending). Everybody just calls that last one *The* *Shed*, even though it's further from the house than the *Old* New Shed. Don't ask me, I don't know why either.

All of these Sheds were built by Bee's ex-husband, whose name was Bently. That's what everybody told me anyway. Ani and Norm say that he was her ex-husband but I don't know about that. Pretty mysterious guy, I still think they all made up the part about him and Bee being a couple. Who cares anyway? Anyway, that's apparently who built all the sheds on Sisters Island. 

The *Old* Old Shed is the oldest one, and it's pretty old. Almost collapsed. It's halfway across the island, in some trees, not far from Townslook, which is a small coastal cliff overlooking Maevis Cove, which I'll tell you about another time.

 I slept in it four times, but it's kind of creepy and I get weird vibes around it sometimes, so I kind of just leave the *Old* Old Shed alone now, because the Spirit mostly shows up around there, when it does decide to. 

The Old New shed was what Bently built closest to the house, after he got tired of trekking way out into the woods to build whatever he built in the Old Old shed. We keep all the lawn stuff in there, and extra chicken feed. We currently don't have any chickens. The last six we had all escaped and most probably got eaten but every now and then I catch sight of the crazy one, running around like it owns the whole island. I leave chicken feed out for it, so it doesn't go hungry. I guess it prefers being a wild chicken.

The New *Old* Shed is a few hundred yards from the house - not as far as the *Old* Old shed, but pretty far - and in the direction of the orchard, which is over the low ridge, Bay-side. Bently built that one after Bee and he had their big fight from before, and he missed having a shed that was *further* away from the house, that he could actually also get to in the Winter. He hadn't really thought about Winter when he picked where to put the *Old* Old shed - but now he had two sheds under his belt, so he knew more about planning sheds, so he built the *New* Old shed. 

The *New* Old Shed is the coziest shed. You can see the Ocean from its very small front porch. It has a little balcony on the top too, and you have to climb a short ladder to get to it. It's like somebody took a decent small house and shrunk it down to one-third scale. Today they call that a tiny home, but it's still really just a shed. That's the shed Oliv had run off towards, and that was the same one I had ran off toward, too,when I first decided to run away, right around the time I first stayed with Bee, right around Oliv's age, almost exactly. I was thinking about this while I was hobble-hiking toward the New, Old Shed through the woods, hoping to find her.

Just to finish the shed story, the fourth one is the New *New* Shed, or just, the *Shed*. It's at the edge of the property, near where Norm likes to park his truck or minivan or hatchback or whatever he's currently got, and whenever he decides to visit like a madman, by driving over the causeway in any weather, whatsoever. That shed's where all the car things go, and also is where the workshop is. It's pretty functional, like an above-average shed. Sometimes I think of it more as a garage, but Bently always called his outbuildings *sheds*, so I'm not going to mess with that tradition. Why would I?

Maybe I'll tell you more about the sheds later, I have no idea. I'm getting off topic anyway. I've found a lot of stuff in those sheds and had a few adventures in them too and I just realized I could write a book about just that first Summer when I came to stay with Bee, and explored Sisters Island and learned about Spirits, and fired the .22 in anger for the first time, and I'm just going to hav to leave those stories for later. I'm telling you about my cousin right now, and where she went, and what she needs.

The morning's blue sky is vivid blue through the trunk of the trees, where they give way to the top ridge fence of the wide, old, ornery orchard, which rolls and spreads its way, gently downhill, from that tree line, and outward down below, over the rocks, and toward the Bay. Right where the little forest meets the apple field, old Bently's New, Old Shed sits - squat and cozy - its front porch big enough for only two. There's a bucket for catching water, and there was once a door, but who needed that anymore? It has become a workable work table around the side... and inside, a bed frame where an air mattress can go, and a small cast-iron stove, and an old counter made new (though now some time ago), and some shelves and a desk and what else did a person need? Maybe a book? There are a few. 

Maeve comes out of the trees and takes a look at the orchard sprawling around and down toward the shore and Bay, and she doesn't see her cousin in any of it, and she comes around the side of the shed and Olivia isn't sitting on the stoop either, looking like some gloomy Gus, and Maeve goes into the shed and looks around twice and says to herself, "Huh." Olivia isn't where Maeve thought she'd be.

It's a big island. Maevis knows all the hiding spots - that's what she thinks - but it is still a big island. Her foot is sore, but it doesn't matter - she has a mission. She calls Olivia's name, twice, three times.  She comes back down the steps, and sits for a bit. There's a good breeze coming up from below, she can see past the bigger, older, elder trees of the orchard, such big swaths of water. The boats are out, away out there - several fishing, one or two just sailing around. 

Further out, to their left, the Settlements on the Arm, and beyond that, the lighthouse at the Bay's Neck. Across the Bay, on their right, the beginnings of docks along the banks of the town of Elders Falls. Most of the town is still further to the right, far beyond the nearby tree line, at the nearest-by edge of the orchard, where the crooked fence was run. Those whole, little regions along that quarter of their island - the one facing the Elders' town across the Bay - is all those smooth, rough rocks and weirdly crags and stoney holes and hollows and grubby gulleys and funny small cliffs and even a marshy bit or two, and the most twisted, wind-dried tangle of trees... and then all those old, old bees... That's the part of the island where Maevis is sure the Gnomes must roam, when they decide to stray a bit further from home.

Olivia wouldn't have gone *that* far though, Maevis was fairly sure. For all Maeve knew, maybe Oliv was already back at the house, getting an earful from Norm. Maeve doesn't want to go in the wrong direction, and spend the day looking in the wrong place. Dooley would have found Olivia by now, easy-peasy. Maeve isn't worried though. It's a big island, but she isn't worried. Something tells her Oliv isn't far at all. That was not an, *I'm-running-away-from-home-to-join-the-circus* sort of escape she saw Olivia do. That was an, *I-don't-want-to-talk-to-anybody-right-now-unless-they-come-and-find-me* sort of escape. Maeve knows all about the different kinds of those.

Then she knows where Oliv probably is. She gets off the little shed's little stoop, heads back into the woods toward the house, but halfway there, turns right into a little glen, where there are wild blueberries growing in the dappled sunlight, and there's a finch flitting around and making a big racket, and some dragonflies perturbed and a garter snake wippleing away through the grass from her as she enters the glade where the blueberries are. Down among the bushes, is her cousin Olivia, big frown on her face, sitting with her arms around her knees, and her phone on the ground beside her, under-employed. 

"There's my favourite blueberry" says Maeve, leading with humour, she hoped, and, "You found any cell coverage in there?"

"Not laughing." Olivia says, then, "Go away."

"Nope." Maeve wades her way into the blueberry bushes, not enjoying the scratches. "Move over" she says to Olivia, who heaves a big sigh but picks up her phone and shoves some bushes away to make barely enough room. There's not a lot of room. Maeve struggles to get seated with her footbrace and her crutch gets caught in the branches and she just tosses it back where she came from, and then sits like Olivia, and then just waits for her cousin to say something.

"What are you *doing*, Maeve?"

"What are *you* doing, Olivia?"

"Stop it. It's not funny. I'm tired of all this crap about school."

"Norm and Claudette have been worried. You can't run off like that. Not on an island. That's a Bad Move."

"I don't care."

"Yes you do. And I do too, and it's my house now, and my rules. Don't do that again. I'm serious."

Olivia scrunches up her face - like she's going to say something inappropriate, but then thinks better of it - and shakes her head and just stamps her foot, drawing her knees in even closer.

"Ouch. What's going on at school?"

"Uh, *uh*." Olivia just shakes her head again. "No. Not talking about that. I'm not going to school."

Maeve grabs some convenient blueberries and starts eating. "What, never again?"

Olivia is annoyed. "I'm *not* going tomorrow. They can ground me or take my stupid phone or whatever. I don't care. I'm not going. And you're not making me either, Maeve."

Maeve holds up her blueberry-stained hands, "I'm just the cousin who doesn't want you falling into the ocean like a dumbass and drowning. I don't care if you don't go to school. School, whatever. So stupid, right?"

Olivia's poking at her phone. "You never have data on this stupid island."

"Don't call the Sisters *stupid* - it can hear you." Maeve smears blueberry juice on Oliv's forehead, and Oliv yells "*Frig off!*", batting the hand away, but still too late - juiced. "you're *weird*, Maeve."

"And you're probably grounded, and I'm not. I'm not even in trouble, so. I need to tell your parents that you're OK now."

"I'm *not* going back with them! I won't. I'm not going. Don't."

"Calm down, Jeebus", Maeve is regretting having sat down a bit. She's having a tough time getting back on her feet. She's got her hand on Olivia's head for leverage and Olivia yells "*Frig off!*" again and then Maeve's up and swats her cousin on the head and says, "I'll be right back, *stay here*. You're not going to school, don't worry. I'll be back in twenty-five minutes. Maybe twenty-eight. Less than thirty. *Stay here*. Eat natural blueberries, they fight cancer."

Olivia looks at Maeve, who's retrieving her crutch from the nearby bushes. "What do you *mean*? Is this a trick?"

"*What?* You just said you're not going to school, right? Am I wrong? Are you talking about the blueberries? What's going on right now?"

Olivia looks confused, but then says, "Yeah... no. No, I'm not going."

Maeve's got her crutch back under her arm, and her foot's killing her again. She needs ice cream. "That's what I'm going to tell your folks." Maeve starts hobbling away, then turns around and points her crutch at Olivia, "But if you don't do your homework, I'm sending you back."

Olivia just feels herself nod, and watches Maeve hobble back out of the blueberry glade and back into the woods. Olivia's phone's battery is dead, even though it was almost at half when Maeve showed up. 

But she's not going to school tomorrow. She starts to breathe again, a little bit.

---

I went back and found Claudette in the kitchen trying to get cell phone service, which made no sense, and I told her that I found Oliv and she was fine but she wasn't going back to school, and Claudette was about to tell me that oh, no, I was wrong about that, and then I said, Hey. Claudette. I'm serious here. I made a promise. Oliv's staying with me this week. If she doesn't do her homework once, unless there's a good reason, then you can take her back. We'll watch Fraggle Rock and eat ice cream. I'll make her clean the house for me. I got lots of jobs I'm not doing that need doing. 

I think Claudette just needed to sit down and have a think about everything - maybe something about how I said all of that made her not want to argue anyway, either way she just sat down at the table and rubbed her forehead and muttered in French, and I don't speak that well, so I just said that I was going to go tell Norm, and Claudette nodded and so I grabbed my ice cream from the counter and hobbled all the Jeebus way down Driveway Road to the dock. 

I met a crow walking up toward the house from the other way - they always see to show up at mildly inconvenient times - and we sort of looked at each other while we passed, and that's a whole other thing that's been going on around here for years now and I'll tell you about it some other time. The crows don't fly on Sisters Island - they walk. It's not that common to see, because they don't visit often, but sometimes I see one walking around, or walking by, or whatever. They usually look at me, sometimes like, *Hey*. Sometimes I think they might even flap a wing at me, but I haven't seen one do that yet. Sometimes they look like they might though. Anyway, I'll tell you about all that some other time. I have a few Crow stories. One has a Gnome in it.

I got to the dock and Norm was walking around doing nothing and I guess I can imagine how it might feel to not know where your eleven-year old was, after they've just run off, so I didn't waste time with suspense. I told him that I found her she's OK and he said well where'd she go? And I said she was staying with me for the week, and that I found her in the blueberries, and she wasn't going back with them today, because she's staying with me, because I almost broke my leg, because of you. That's kind of what I said to Norm. 

I'm not the best at reading people's faces, but his did a couple of things, but when he didn't actually say anything, I just said OK and started to hobble back to the house, and almost fell, but Normand caught me and we walked together on the way back up. We didn't see that Crow again, and Norm said thanks for finding our Oliv, again, and I said any time.
