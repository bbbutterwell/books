## Olives & Blueberries

*version 0430*

It's Sunday morning and Normand got the wrong type of tacks for the roofing shingles, and I guess there was some kind of paper you're supposed to put down under them too, so he and Claudette argued some more because now it's Sunday and the stores are closed, because the stores in Elders Falls still do that old-timey thing of not opening on Sunday, so people who work retail don't have to feel like they need to work every damn day of their life.

Claudette got mad at Normand because he waited until Sunday to put the shingles up, and now the stores are closed, and they both have to get back to work tomorrow. I think they're worried I'll try shingling the roof while I have a foot brace on, which is not really likely. 

Norm only got to trying to shingle today because he ended up spending all yesterday trying to figure out where all the bird noises were coming from up there on the roof and I said I didn't know, the birds were just up there somewhere, sometimes, so he got kind of mad and told me I can't just let birds move into the roof, they were going to poop all over the place and ruin everything. He didn't use that word exactly, but you get it.

What am I going to do about birds living in the house anyway? I'm not a pest control service. Besides, they have a right to be here too. Some of those birds' families have been on the island for longer than I've been alive, anywhere. But not in the house, Normand says, the house isn't for Scritters. But he knows that's not true. It's always been a stalemate between the Folk and the Scritters, on Sisters Island.

Anyway, that was Saturday, yesterday. Norm would go and put the Giant Ladder against some part of the house somewhere and go up there and hear some birds, and start stomping around trying to figure out where they were hiding, and then he'd stomp back down and come in to get some pop or juice or a flashlight, and he'd ask me how long the birds had been living in the roof or the soffits or the attic or wherever he thought they were, and I'd shrug and say I really didn't know, because I really don't. Claudette and I were busy watching all the Fraggle Rock seasons on VHS right then - and eating pie and ice cream and cheddar cheese - which was all the plan, and I wasn't deviating. I didn't want to be bothered with worrying about where all the birds happened to be, right now.

Then Normand would grumble and go back outside and move the Giant Ladder to some other part of the house and stomp around up there and find more birds and come back down and tell me I had a serious bird problem, did I know that? But I just wanted to watch Fraggle Rock with Claudette and not talk about anything at all, really. Eventually Claudette told Norm he wasn't allowed to come in and tell us about any new birds he'd found anywhere. So he spent the next couple more hours after that, stomping around all over the place up there and grumbling to himself loud enough to hear, and we all knew he was still finding birds all over the place, anyway.

That was yesterday, Saturday. I had seen Olivia just once that whole visit, really quickly, when they all first got here on Friday, when she skulked into the kitchen real quick to grab enough food to keep herself going for the rest of the weekend, without coming out from her room. 

She was hermit-ing pretty hard in the upstairs small one all Friday night and yesterday. That's the little room with the tower window sill that looks over the chickens' coop. That used to be my favourite room to hermit in, also. I get it.

Now it's Sunday morning and Claudette and Normand can't figure out where Olivia is. She's not in her room anymore. That's not a big surprise, because they just got into a big fight about school last night and she started yelling and Norm started telling her, in old Bently's voice, *that's enough, young lady*, and that really got her going and she just stomped upstairs and slammed her door two times, and then wouldn't come out for anyone, and they said fine, no dinner then, but she already had her food stocked up in there, and they knew that, so I don't think that really won them anything. 

Olive's also cross that we don't get Internet on the Island and the data coverage is usually not. Claudette and Norm decided to just let her be, and they'd talk about it later. I guess that was a good plan. I don't like Internet that much, I'll be honest, except for some things. When I need it, I go to the Elders Falls Public Library. I need reasons to go there to be around Folk sometime, so that's a pretty good reason to go, to get on the Internet. I have to go there soon to see if Arthur got that email I sent him last week. 

Now Oliv's not in her room. We looked all over the house, and then I heard the back porch door, and she was trying to be sneaky about getting out. By the time I had hobbled over, I saw her out in the backyard, way over by the trees, on the other side of the Gnome garden. She ran right into the trees. Oliv's never done *that* before. Right into the trees, no pauses. I'm not sure what to call that. I get it though. Last year, Olivia was still scared of bushes, because I told her there were gobs of bees somewhere on the island, I just couldn't remember where. She wouldn't go near a bush for a while, and Norm can't convince me that was my fault. Anyway, I guess Olive's not scared of bushes anymore, so that's good.

I told Norm and Claudette their kid was loose, and they acted like they hadn't even thought that could happen. What the hell. It's a big island, and Oliv's eleven now and she's been mad at everybody for a whole year, so what did they expect? She'd eventually going to bolt.

Norm and Claudette both took off into the trees in different directions, and I headed up to the widow's watch and watched the causeway, using my backpacking telescope, which is my medium one, in case Oliv decided to hoof it back to the mainland road herself, and try something dumb like hitchhiking or walking along the road. But I didn't see anybody else come or go on the causeway, and then the tide was up to the danger tape about fifty minutes later, and I knew Olivia would stay on the island, because she's terrified of the rowboat. I guess I don't blame her. It's due for a fix. I went back downstairs once I knew Oliv was on the island. I know all the hiding places. I'd find her.

Normand and Claudette were back and starting to worry a little bit by then - but not like their daughter had run into the big woods. This were the small woods, with Small Scritters, and one way on the island, and nothing but family on it. We all know the island pretty well. I know it best. But Normand knows almost all the places on it that I do. Claudette knows most of the standard places. But still, this is the ocean. We had to find her. I figured she'd come back on her own, but you never know.

I'm not sure yet how much of the island Oliv knows. She's only eleven, but eleven-year old Oliv is already twice as brave as ten-year-old Oliv was. I have been watching her get braver, her whole life. I notice these things. I think some people don't think that I do, but I definitely do. I know all about how brave people are. That's one of my favourite things about them - how brave they are, when they decide. I'm trying to learn that. Some days I'm getting better.

Some days I remember how much I really miss Dooley. Dooley would have found Oliv in six-and-a-half seconds, or maybe ten. He didn't always look like he knew what he was doing, but he always knew what he was doing, when it really mattered. He saved my life, two or maybe three times. Pretty average for an un-average dog like Dools. Lots of good dogs save people's lives. They don't care much if we notice, you know - they just want some scritches and a treat or two, a good run now and then, and to then to know that we love them. So I wish my old Dog Dooley was still about and around. 

That old hound. I still stop sometimes in the middle of whatever it is I'm doing, and just think about Dooley, and what he must be up to, wherever he is right now. It still happens. I might get another dog someday, maybe soon. I don't know. For child safety reasons.

But I told Claudette one of them should go down to the dock and just hang out there to make sure Oliv wouldn't try using the boat or maybe wading across the causeway, which I'm pretty sure she'd never, ever do, because that would be dumb, and I've told her that forever, but then you just never know. You might not know what the causeway's like. You might think it could ever be calm enough in the sky for it to be truly safe to cross -  but this is the ocean, so it's never *really* fun. The waves crash against the causeway even on calm days, sometimes - when you really don't think there's going to be a wave in sight, but right then, when you're thinking that, it will happen sometimes, sometimes the wind will pick up, or something's happened offshore, and there's a moment when, where you're standing then won't be where the water won't be any more, when you would have been, three minutes before. 

You think you're safe, and then you're not, that's all. You were wrong that time. This isn't just what the causeway is like, on Sisters Island - this is what the Sisters is like, almost everywhere she meets the water , around Her skirt. There are places on Sisters Island where I will go without any emergency gear, even on a not-great day. And then there's a place or two I will never go, and many different others in between. It's usually a small gamble that can be made smaller, by just knowing when the tides were in and out. 

I haven't told you about the teeth that ring the Sisters, on all Her sides, except one - the teeth that come and go, with the rising and the falling of the Sea. When the ocean surrounds you, knowing what is coming and what is going - and from where - this is what keeps you alive a little longer - long enough to learn the lessons which the island will teach you, as long as it doesn't take you. You have to be able to slow dance with the sea. And the sea always leads that dance - your job is to be a better partner, by knowing what and when and how to follow.

But above all, you must always be brave and true.

Even at low tide you can get drenched if the wind's a certain way, and you're standing in the wrong spot. That's why Norm's a madman for *ever* driving across it, even at lowest tide, which is the only time he ever does - but does he ever, when he does.

Anyway, I didn't really have to finish explaining about somebody needing to guard the dock, it was obvious, and just needed a nudge and was off down the driveway as soon as I started saying it. I told Claudette to stay around the house in case Oliv came back, but to also check the henhouse and the Old, New Shed, which is the shed that's closest to the house. I was going to go search the island and find Oliv. I know all the hiding spots. That's what I told her.

Claudette told me I shouldn't walk around on the island with my foot the way it is, but I had the crutch she brought me and I had taken my Tylenol and now that I had a mission, I didn't feel quite so bad really. You know how they say when a kid's in danger, like trapped under a car or something, how a mom can get super strong, and lift it off? Well I'm only Oliv's cousin but I'm old enough to be her aunt, so I think I had a kind of almost-mom strength and that's why my leg didn't really give me so much trouble, once Oliv took off. That's some kind of Science again.

I told Claudette look, I know all the hiding spots on the island. There isn't one I haven't found already. Oliv's pretty smart, but she's not Island-savvy like I am. I'll find her. 

That's what I said, and I meant it. Claudette said OK, and I hobbled into the backyard, and past the Gnome Garden, where I've had the most Gnome sightings, but none too recently.

I went into the tree line where I had seen Oliv go, and then I headed through the woods toward the New Old Shed, which was a few hundred yards away, just over the ridge and toward the old orchard. 

I guess I should mention about the sheds, I don't know. Maybe it will be useful lore, later on. There are four sheds on Sisters Island. There's the *Old* Old Shed, the Old *New* Shed, the New *Old* Shed, and the *New* New Shed (or the New *New* Shed, depending). Everybody just calls that last one *The* *Shed*, even though it's further from the house than the *Old* New Shed. Don't ask me, I don't really know why any of this, either.

All of the Sheds were built by Bee's ex-husband, Bently. That's what everybody told me he was, anyway. They all said he was her ex-husband but I don't know about that. I never met him, I only heard all the stories. He built a lot of pretty cool things around the island. I'm always finding his tools and plans and sometimes maps. I still think they all made up the part about him and Bee being a couple. Who cares anyway? Anyway, that's apparently who built all the sheds on Sisters Island. 

The *Old* Old Shed is the oldest one, and it's pretty old. Almost collapsed. It's halfway across the island, in some trees, not far from Townslooksee, which is a small cliff overlooking Maevis Cove, which I'll tell you about some other time.

 I slept in the Old, Old Shed four times in total, but it is kind of creepy and I get weird vibes around it now and then, so I kind of just leave the Old *Old* Shed alone now, because the Spirit mostly shows up close to there, when it shows up. 

The Old *New* shed was what Bently built the closest to the house, after he got tired of trekking way out into the woods to build whatever he built in the Old Old shed. This was after Bee's Sisters' houses both had those things happen to them. You remember, with the tiny crater, and the Big Willow tree. We keep all the lawn stuff in there, and extra chicken feed. We currently don't have any chickens though. The last six we had all escaped and most probably got eaten or swept to Seas, but every now and then I catch sight of that one crazy one, running around like it owns the whole island. I leave chicken feed out for it, so it doesn't go hungry. I guess it prefers being a wild chicken. I'm a bit wary of it, I'll admit it.

The New *Old* Shed is a few hundred yards from the house - not as far as the *Old* Old shed, but pretty far - and in the direction of the orchard, which is over the low ridge, Bay-side. Bently built that one after Bee and he started up their big fight from before, and he missed having a shed that *was* further away from the house, that he could actually also get to, even in the Winter. He hadn't really thought about Winter here, when he first picked where to put the *Old* Old shed - but now he had *two* sheds under his belt, so he knew more about planning sheds, so he built the *New* Old shed in a much better place.

The *New* Old Shed is the coziest one. You can see the Ocean from its very small front porch. It has a little balcony on the top too, and you have to climb a short ladder to get to it. It's like somebody took a pretty Ok, small house and shrunk it down to about two-fifths scale. Today they call that a tiny home, but it's still really just a shed. 

The *New* Old Shed was the shed that Oliv had run off in the direction of, and that was the same one that I had ran off toward too, when I first decided to run away, right around the time I first stayed with Bee, right around almost Oliv's age, exactly. I was thinking about this while I was hobble-hiking toward the New Old Shed, through the woods, wondering how I'd find her.

Just to finish the shed story though - the fourth one is the New *New* Shed, or just, the *Shed*. It's at the edge of the front lawn, near where Norm likes to park his vehicles, when he's being a madman and having mild adventures. That the shed where all the car things go, and also is where the small workshop is. It's pretty functional, like a good, above-average shed. Sometimes I think of it more as a garage, but Bently always just called all his outbuildings *sheds*, so I'm not going to mess with that tradition. Why would I? I forgot to tell you out the Outshed. I guess that makes five sheds. Six, if you count the ChickenShed.

Maybe I'll tell you more about the sheds later, I have no idea. I'm getting way off topic anyway. I've found a lot of stuff in those sheds over the years and had a few adventures in them too and I just realized I could write a book just about that first Summer when I came to stay with Bee, and explored Sisters Island and learned about Spirits, and fired the .22 in anger for the first time, and I'm just going to have to leave those stories for later. 

I'm telling you about my cousin right now, and where she went, and what she needs.

---

The morning sky is vivid blue through the trunks of the trees, where they give way at last, at the  top ridge and the high fence of the wide, old, ornery orchard, which rolls and spreads its way gently downhill, from that tree line, and outward below, and across the track and over the rocks, and into the waters, and out into the Bay. Right where the little forest makes way for the apples, old Bently's new Old Shed sits - squat and cozy - its front porch big enough for just two. There's a bucket for water getting, and there was once a door, but who needed that anymore? It has become a workable work table around on the side... and inside, a bed frame where an air mattress might go, and a small cast-iron stove, and an old counter made new (though now some time ago), and some shelves and a desk and what else did a person need? A book or puzzle, or some paper? There are a few of those things, scattered around too. 

Maeve comes out of the trees and takes a look at the orchard down toward the shore and Bay, and she doesn't see her cousin in any of it, and she's not among the tree lines, and she comes around the side of the shed and Olivia isn't sitting on the stoop in either chair, looking like some gloomy Gus, and Maeve steps up into the shed and looks around twice and says to herself, "Huh." Olivia isn't where Maeve first thought she'd be.

It's a big island. Maevis knows all the hiding spots - she is sure that's what she thinks - but it is still a big island. Her foot is still sore, but it doesn't matter, like before - she has a mission. She calls Olivia's name, twice, three times.  She comes back down the steps, and sits for a bit. There's a good breeze coming up from below, with nothing unusual on it, and she can see past the bigger, older, elders of the orchard, such great swaths of water. The boats are out, away out there - several fishing, one or two just sailing about. 

Further on, away to their left, the Settlements on the Arm, and beyond that, the Lighthouse Rock at the Bay's Broken Neck. Across and away on their right, the very beginnings of old docks along the lower tidal banks of the town of Elders Falls. Most of the town is still further on, rightward, far beyond the nearby tree line, at the nearest edge of the orchard, where the oldest part of the crooked fencing still ran. Those whole, little regions along that full quarter of their island - the one facing the Elders' town across the Bay - is all those smooth, rough rocks glossy sea mossiness and weird-some crags and sullen, stoney holes and hollows and gulleys of gravel spilled into grassy crumbled cliffs and even a marshy lowly bit or two, and the twisted, wind-dried barren tangle of twigly trees... and then all those old, Elder Bees... That's the part of the island where Maevis is sure the Gnomes must roam, when they decide to stray a touch away from proper home.

Olivia wouldn't have gone *that* far though, Maevis was fairly sure. For all she knew, maybe Oliv was already back at the house, getting an earful from Norm. Maeve doesn't want to go in the wrong direction, and spend the day looking in the wrong spot. 

Dooley would have found Olivia by now, easy-peasy. Maeve isn't worried though. It's a big island, but she isn't worried. Something tells her Oliv isn't far at all. That was not an *I'm-running-away-from-home-to-join-the-circus* sort of escape, which she saw Olivia do. That was an *I-don't-want-to-talk-to-anybody-right-now-unless-they-come-and-find-me* sort of escape. Maeve knows all about the different kinds.

Then she knows where Livii probably is. She gets off the little shed's little stoop, heads back into the woods toward the house, but halfway there, turns right into a glen, where there are wild blueberries growing in sunlight patches that move around throughout the days and seasons and years, and there's a finch flitting there while making a racket, and some dragonflies perturbed and a garter snake wippleing away through the grass from her, as Maeve enters the glade where the blueberries always are. Down among the bushes, is her cousin, Olivia, Oliv, Livii, big on her face, forlorn, sitting with her arms around her knees, and her phone on the ground beside her, under-employed. 

"There's my favourite blueberry" says Maeve, leading with humour, she hoped, and, "You found any cell service in there?"

"Not laughing." Olivia says, then, "Go away."

"Nope." Maeve wades her way into the blueberry bushes, never enjoying the scratches. "Move over" she says to Olivia, who then heaves a big sigh but picks up her phone and shoves some bushes away to make barely enough room. There's not a lot of room. Maeve struggles to get seated among all the blueberries with her footbrace getting snagged and her crutch getting fetched up and she just tosses it back where she came from, and then sits like Olivia, and then waits for her cousin to say something.

"What are you *doing*, Maevis?"

"What are *you* doing, Olivia?"

"Stop it. It's not funny. I'm tired of all this crap about school."

"Norm and Claudette have been worried. You can't run off like that. Not on an island. That's a Bad Move."

"I don't care."

"Yes, you do. And I do, and it's my house now, and my rules forever. Don't do that again. Not here. I'm serious."

Olivia scrunches up her face - like she's going to say something inappropriate, but then thinks better of it - and shakes her head and just stamps her foot in the grass.

"Ouch. What's going on at school?"

"Nuh-*uh*." Olivia just shakes her head again. "No. Not talking about that. I'm not going to school. I'm not talking about it, I'm not going."

Maeve grabs some convenient blueberries and starts eating. "What, never?"

Olivia is annoyed. "I'm *not* going tomorrow. They can ground me or take my stupid phone or whatever, it doesn't work anyway, I don't care. I'm not going. And you're not my parent and you're not going to either."

Maeve holds up her blueberry-stained hands, "I'm just the cousin who doesn't want you falling into the ocean and drowning like a dumb-ass. I don't care if you don't go to school. School, whatever. So stupid, right?"

Olivia's poking at her phone. "You never have any data on this stupid island."

"I don't think that's true. And don't call the Sisters *stupid* - it can *hear* *you*." 

Maeve smears blueberry juice on Oliv's forehead, and Oliv yells "*Frig off!*", batting the hand away, too late "you're *weird*, Maeve."

"And you're grounded, probably, and I'm not. I'm not even in trouble, so. I need to tell your parents that you're OK now."

"I'm *not* going back! I won't. I'm not going. Don't."

"Calm down, Jeebus", Maeve is regretting having sat down a bit. She's having a tough time getting back on her feet now - blueberry bushes are hard to hang on to for support. She's got her hand on Olivia's head for leverage and Olivia yells again and then Maeve's up and swats her cousin on the head and says, "I'll be right back. *Stay here*. I'm serious. You're not going to school, don't worry. I'll be back in twenty-five minutes. Maybe twenty-eight. Less than thirty. *Stay here*. Eat natural blueberries, they fight cancer."

Olivia looks at Maeve retrieving her crutch from the nearby bushes. "What do you mean? Is this a trick?"

"*What?* You just said you're not going to school, right? Am I wrong? Are you talking about the blueberries now? I don't understand what's happening."

Olivia looks confused, but then says, "Yeah... no. No, I'm not going to school. I don't want to leave."

Maeve's got her crutch back under her arm, and her foot's killing her again. She needs ice cream. "That's what I'm going to tell your folks." Maeve starts hobbling away, then turns around and points her crutch back at Olivia, "But if you don't do your homework, I'm sending you back."

Olivia just feels herself nod, and watches Maeve hobble back out of the blueberry glade and back into the woods. Olivia's phone's battery is dead, even though it was almost at half when Maeve showed up. 

But she's not going to school tomorrow. She starts to breathe again, a little bit.

---

I went back and found Claudette in the kitchen. She was trying to get cell phone service, which made no sense, and I told her that I found Oliv and she was fine but she wasn't going back to school that week, and Claudette was about to tell me that oh, no, I was wrong about that, and then I said, Hey. Claudette. I'm serious here. I made a promise. Oliv's staying with me this week. If she doesn't do her homework once, unless there's a good reason, then you can take her back. We'll watch Fraggle Rock and eat ice cream. I'll make her clean the house for me. I've got lots of jobs I'm not doing that need doing. That's what I said to Claudette, while she listened.

I think Claudette just really needed to sit down and have a think about everything - maybe something about how I said all of that made her not want to argue anyway, either way she just sat down at the table and rubbed her forehead a lot, and muttered in French, and I don't speak it that well, so I just said that I was going to go tell Norm now, and she nodded and so I grabbed my ice cream from the fridge and hobbled all the Jeebus way down Driveway Road to the dock. I could have taken Norm's car but it takes the same amount of tie to walk, by the time you account for finding the keys most times. That's about how long Driveway Road is.

I met a crow walking up toward the house from the other way, on the right - they always seem to show up at kind-of inconvenient times - and we sort of looked at each other while we passed, and that's a whole other thing that's been going on around here for years now and I'll tell you about it some other time, probably. The crows don't fly on Sisters Island. They walk. It's not that common to see, because they don't visit often, but sometimes I see one walking around, or walking by, or whatever. They usually look at me, sometimes like, *Hey*. Sometimes I think one might even flap a wing at me sometime, but I haven't seen one do that yet. Sometimes they look like they might though. Anyway, I'll tell you about all that some other time. I have a few Crow stories. One has a Gnome in it.

I got to the dock and Norm was walking around doing nothing and I guess I can imagine how it might feel to not know where your eleven-year old was, after they've just run off, so I didn't waste time with suspense. I told him that I found her and she's OK and he said well where'd she go? And I said she was staying with me for the week, and that I found her in the blueberries where I knew she'd be, and she wasn't going back with them today, because she's staying with me, because I almost broke my leg, because of you. That's kind of what I said to Norm. 

I'm not the best at reading people's faces, but his face did a couple of things, but when he didn't actually say anything, I just said OK and started to hobble back to the house, and almost fell, but Normand caught me and we walked together on the way back up. We didn't see that Crow again, and Norm said thanks for finding the Olive, again, and I said well, any time.
