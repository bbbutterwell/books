## Crossroads

*version 0505*

*Field Account #472*

*Fenrii Netherlight,*

*Observator, 2nd rank, HOO*

*Third Thirdsdaii, Autumn, WoM 121*

*Master Noonstar and I have been traveling slowly Seaward from Owl with the 77th Owlic Mule-borne, and we are soon to break camp on our fifth morning. There have been no great incidents, save for some spontaneous tax collecting, which is never terribly pleasant to observe, though to Owl's credit, its methods are far more intensely bureaucratic and paperwork-laden, than crudely intimidating, as in the days of old, or as in some neighbouring Regencies still.*

*This company of men is mostly young, and the majority have yet to see any fighting in the field. There are a few old grognards, and one or two of varied experience who seem to take some satisfaction in the exacting of tolls from travellers and labourers alike, for the use of the Kings Roads and Fields, whenever the opportunity arises. The company's captain, a middling man with a regal nose, named Nells (Nells being the man, and not the nose), turns a blind eye to this toll-taking only at times, and is mostly content to do what is needed to keep the men from any premature discontent. It is untrue that mutinies only happen at sea.* 

*And so, our traveling coffers are somewhat heftier already, and the men's spirits are high, since that will be where their Moondaii ciders will come from, along the long journey around and back again. We've left no fomenting revolts in our wake, as best my mentor and I are able to discern. I've seen worse patrol captains than Nells, and a few better ones too.*

*I have endeavoured dearly to practice my wanting crafts of Observation, and have asked Master Noonstar to inform me each time I become, even for a moment, too Storied in the eyes of the men. We have agreed for now not to count those occasions when the cleverest burro, whom we've named Hound, chooses to make it known to us that it can still tell what we're up to. It does not seem to care whether any of the soldiers do, and none of its kin seem to notice us at all, even when it is clearly on our scent. Hound, for now, is to be an anomaly, and also an opportunity to hone our finer skills with particular challenges. I am uncertain from from where his preternatural sense arises, as he is otherwise utterly nondescript among his kind.*

*I have managed to remain fully un-present to over three-quarters of the men now, for these past several days, and have begun, I think, to learn how to sink back again into the background more surely and suddenly, when occasions arise where I am perceived, and then recalled as having been met before, somewhere. Only two of the older men seem to be growing somewhat in their suspicions, each time we re-meet. Noonstar has suggested I simply remain opposite them in the camp for now, until I have mastered disappearing from the minds of the younger ones.*

*By Third Soondaii eve, we could see Owl only by its now-faint ambience in the evening sky, and by yesterday, the hills stood entirely between us and home, and we skirted the edge of the Bollburii Bog, which stretches clear to the Rightward Sea, though nothing but a fog fills one's vision, in all directions and at all times of day there - so none would ever know where the ocean was, until they had waded clear into it, up to their neck. We moved carefully along that stretch, staying toward the driest land when possible, as the boardwalks and bridges are forever in a state of rot. Every Owlic patrol's duty includes repairs of the King's Road, along the way. The captain ordered a few logs and planks and posts replaced here and there at first, but for the most part, we soldiered quickly on. Others would do their part, presumably, to keep the paths passable enough in that place. Few came this way anyhow, anymore. The Bogs, you see, are almost entirely new. They were once farmland, called the Bollberii Fields, not so long ago.*

*Bugbears were seen in the swampy ditches amid the fog, by several men, as we neared early eve - greater numbers than had been expected, and this was the point when the men no longer muled about so casually, trading shots of bravado and nonsense. Bugbears are not known to be all too brazen, unless they have the clear advantage in numbers - at least, Master Noonstar assures me, by a factor of six-to-one, or more. They did not appear to number more than triple our company, at their largest apparent count, though every hour we spent along the Bollburiis by the end of that day, more of them seemed to arrive out of the wetland, drawn by the news of our presence, perhaps, and the scent too, no doubt, of our many mules. Always though, approaching only to the fringes of where the fog would let us see them for certain - how many behind them, always unknown.*

*The captain wisely had us march straight through that night, and aside from one laborious and troubling long wade around a newly felled bridge, our surroundings and ourselves lit by torchlights alone, in the otherwise gloom - and after which, two mules were found to be missing, once we had reached the other side - we had no more worrisome encounters in that place. By the following morning, we had left the Bogs behind, along with a half-filled coffer of freshly collected tax, several tents, and the hapless mules that had carried them for us that far. Simply earned, and simply lost, as the old adage goes.*

*On the fourth day of our journey, yesterday, during a moderate and persistent rainfall, we were sheltering within a copse of low-slung Oddwoods, and that is when Master Bardlii overheard two soldiers talking, which then caught his attention, so that he called me over, and told me where to stand, so as not to be noticed. It was the older of the two, whom the younger called Riteweld, which had us both intrigued.*

*Riteweld, otherwise called Sir Ba* [^interrupted]

Junior Observator Netherlight is propped against a middle-sized Oddwood. He is making his Field Account for Third Thirdsdaii morning, Autumn, WoM 121. He is once again entirely unaware that his mentor is in the company, despite his having mentioned said mentor several times in the very journal entry he is currently writing. When he reviews it, he will recall for the seventh time since this trip began, that I have been here all along.

His *intention* is not the issue, it is entirely his *attention* which is his current challenge, and therefore, mine.

Netherlight is an all-too-willing pupil, but is far too caught up in not being caught, and so he misses things, and gets caught anyway. I will have to explain this to him, once again, in some other way. This is fine, as this is part of my role as Observator, fifth rank. I do not mind passing on what I can, when I'm able. Nonetheless, we have real work ahead of us, and Netherlight is about to commit to print the name of our first subject, which of course, can't be permitted to occur.

Naturally, this very ad-hoc observation, by me, will be stricken from all records, so as not to confuse the final, aggregate one. There is always some editing involved. I have in any event overused my personal pronouns. I would never wish this record to find its way into anything, and so it won't. 

I like fluffy clouds. My favourite colour is summer finch green. I should like to meet a real unicorn someday, I have several questions to ask. 

I sometimes wish that I did not know the precise day and time of my mortal demise.

Middling Observator, Bardlii Noonstar was sitting next to his Junior, Fenrii Netherlight, observing the man's narrative exposition of the previous days' Accounts, filled as it was with speculation and superfluous description and wandering syntaxes. [^offRecord]

There was a value to being verbose in one's Accounts, at times, and there was more often a greater one to being succinct. Bardlii's own Field Accounts of that same stretch of time and space, placed side-by-side with the one he was trying to follow now, while reading over Fenrii's shoulder, were of roughly equal length, in terms of words, but the former contained nothing but objective fact: precise quantities; times; weather conditions; notes on observed flora and fauna, with locations and conditions; the ages, heights, weights, and objectifiable traits of all 41 soldiers, fifty-two (once fifty-four) mules, and one captain, which comprised the entirety of their company (officially); and several dozen additional records of variable type and similar worth. Not a thing one would read for pleasure, to be sure, and that was precisely the point. If you were writing for anyone's pleasure, your own in particular, then you were being subjective, and that was not what history was.

Fenrii's Account, meanwhile, read like some tale told by tall-tale-telling faerie folk, the sorts which are captured at times in Telling Tomes, as they are being Told, and then often sold as curiosities to the idling nobility, and sometimes, the gainfully under-employed.

Bardlii of course had kept his opinions of Fenrii's style of Account-taking to himself, all this time. It was one thing to wax poetic in personal letters, and private road journals, and quite another to do so while doing the job of a wandering Accountant of Deeds. 

It was, however, not his place to bend the Junior's practice into some shape like his own. The Administration back in Owl would decide itself to what extent Fenrii would be required to edit his material afterward, to fit within the permissible schemas defined by the Archive. The natural consequence of substituting hard fact with verbose fancy would be days and nights spent in gruelling effort to dredge forth minute recollections of all those missing details, long after the fact, from his own mind. There were, of course, techniques and tools for this too, and none of them were particularly pleasant. Most, just simply intolerably dull. Fenrii would learn at least some things the hard way, as Bardlii had done himself. There was no other way to learn everything, but to learn some things wrong the first time.

He watched as Fenrii meticulously recounted with his quill the *feeling* of watching taxation occur; the *regality* (not a subjective measurement, by any stretch) of Captain Nells's nose; Observator exercises, practices, and conversations which, by Owlic Law, must be redacted anyhow; mention of armed Owlic patrols avoiding rather than dealing with Bugbear incursions (the whole point of arming a patrol is to deal with these things, after all); and then the impending mention of Sir Barnabas Riteweld, legendary knight of the Order of Elder Knights, and that was when Bardlii had to shut the whole thing down.

So he put his finger on the young Observator's journal, and when Fenrii's quill got to where the finger was waiting, Fenrii near jumped from his own skin.

"The *Fate*!" he nearly screamed, and a full half of the company of soldiers, who were not so spread out as to not notice even a hiding wizard in their midst shout loudly in fright out of nowhere, turned at once to see what the issue was, and who was shouting, and three of them even made moves for their weapons.

Bardlii grabbed Fenrii by his tunic scruff and pulled him around the side of the tree, and they locked eyes, and Fenrii recalled who Bardlii was (once again), and then they both slow-counted to three. Bardlii then stuck his head out, and saw the men had gone back to what they were doing, though two of them continued their conversation with hands upon the pommels of their swords. He scanned around for the older two men who had become subconsciously suspicious of Fenrii's occasional un-presence, and saw, thankfully, they were at the far end of the camp, simply eyeing the other men, and wondering what had caused the stir.[^rangeAndLOS]

Bardlii retreated again behind the Oddoak, and the two rested against it, shielded safely from the company for a time by common, living wood, and this allowed them to let their guards down a bit. Things had been fairly focused for days, and the Middling Observator felt a break was in order.

"Let's give ourselves some space from these men, for a few moments, follow me, Just watch that Hound doesn't see you." And then Bardlii got up and began walking away from the encampment, keeping the Oddwood generally between he and the others, and so Fenrii followed, glancing around for nosey burros, but Hound was eating carrots elsewhere, which were of entirely more interesting than wizards, to Hound.

The two found a small depression through which flowed a brook, and this gave them some earth to put between themselves and the rest, and then Fenrii said, "how long have you been with the company? All this time?"

Bardlii sighed. "Give it a moment, Fenrii. Unwind those thoughts of yours."

And in another moment, Fenrii slumped forward, and put his head in his hands. "I am a failure. I've forgotten you're here, what, seven times now."

"That's good, you've got the count correct this time. You'll get there. I keep telling you that but then you keep not believing me, which causes you to forget. Sit up straight and stop with the self-pity. It was old the first six times."

Fenrii shrugged, then nodded, to concede Bardlii's critique. "What can I do?"

"About not being older and more seasoned than you are right now? I'm not sure, I haven't learned those particular arcane secrets yet, Perhaps when I am even older and more seasoned than I am today, I will be able to answer it." 

"You think my career being in crisis is a joke."

"No, it's... no. I know you are doubting everything. That doesn't really go away, but I can promise you that someday, you will have different, more interesting things to doubt. And you will be doing that doubting in the midst of a Prince's wedding celebration, surrounded by four hundred attendants, or in the midst of a wide field of battle, with knights careening around you but never into you, or atop a treasure hoard, next to an ancient Drake, who has yet to fall asleep, for being so certain there are treasure robbers about. These are the places you will stand, utterly unnoticed, while you grapple with whatever new concern or crisis has most lately befallen you. I can only tell you that."

Fenrii listened, and knew he should believe, but would not.

Bardlii shifted his weight forward, to rest his elbows on his knees. Both of them were covered in the dust and grime of less than a week's travel. They had more ahead of them. Bardlii wished to pace the lessons, and so he said, "Let's go the tenets again. Tell me what they are." 

Fenrii took a breath, and began. "The Aspects of Observation - known informally within our order as the Tenets, are thus: that of Attachment; that of Subjectivity; that of Temporality; that of Certainty. These are the accepted and known ones, and it is understood that we may not know of them all - this is the Fifth Tenet: that of Mystery."

"Good, and what do they mean?"

"Attachment is the degree to which the Observer is unable to remove themselves from the story. This causes a risk of being Storied." 

"And why must this be mitigated?"

"To be observed observing a Story is to change it, and so defile its essential purity. We seek to capture pure histories, for within these alone can be found the insights that perfect the Law."

"And why is the Law in need of perfection?"

"To gain mastery over the future."

"For what purpose?"

"Survival."

"Which is a mortal imperative. And this insight is what?"

"An irreducible truth, which is pure, and must therefore inform the Code."

"Good, now which is next?"

"Subjectivity, or to some, Relativity. This is the Observer's relation to the subject being accounted."

"And which are the subjects, or relatives, if you will?"

"Myself, you, another. Quite simple."

"And what else can we say about this?"

"That the Truth is not to be found in any one subjective direction more than any other."

"Can they be combined?"

"Of course. But there is no way of knowing whether doing so increases or decreases the element of Truth."

"So what is the point of combining the perspectives of these subjects?"

"One subjective stance is meaningless without the other two. I am not a philosopher. This one eludes me more than most."

"So you say. But for now, fine. And what comes next?"

"The Aspect, or Tenet, of Temporality. Again, three orthogonal directions. What occurred? What is occurring? What will occur?"

"And what do we know of this Aspect?"

"The Stately Drakes tell us these directions are all the same. And I don't understand that very well, either."

"Those Drakes see all things happening at the same time."

"What do you mean though, by same time?"

"The Stately Drakes have Higher Time than we, so all of our time simply fits into a single moment of theirs."

"Master, I must admit, this seems a bit speculative. How can we know?"

"That the Stately Drakes are not lying to us? Of course, we cannot know that. They are known to be quite reliable and trustworthy. Though they are Drakes. We're diverging."

"The next is Certainty, sometimes called Accuracy, or even Veracity, or Reliability. It goes by a few names."

"A bit odd, considering, but a helpful pneumonic." Bardlii has produced a small pear from his vest, and one for Fenrii, and he passes it to the Junior, and they both pause to eat a pear apiece, for a moment. They are both thinking of other synonyms with almost describe Accuracy,  accurately. There are several other candidates.

Fenrii continues, anticipating Bardlii's next question, "Certainty manifests differently, depending on the temporal mode. If I speak of an event in my past, the Tenet of Certainty suggests that I might be wholly right, wholly wrong, or more likely, somewhere in between. If I speak of an event in my future, the Tenet of Certainty suggests that I am constructing my own probabilities. Certainty is not the same, in all the directions you look. "

Bardlii nods, "and what of now?"

"That slim razor's edge, I am not so sure it exists at all, being that it is so impossibly small."

Bardlii didn't know about that. "Imagine that you are a Stately Drake then, if it helps - what does it mean to be some sort of certain, when you are one of those, seeing all things at once?"

"I think that must then be just a matter of opinion. As in, what is this, I am witnessing, in its entirety? Rather than, this was, or that might be. Again, I am unsure I am up for the task of Accounting for anything. I do not understand what any of these Tenets we talk about truly mean."

Bardlii nods, and throws his pear's core into the nearby brook, and watches it bob and slowly float away. It is already in the ocean, in some part, somewhere. It might still be a seed too, in the Archive, somewhere, which rumoured to house all Records, owing to anomalies entirely too tangled consider. Even the Stately Drakes are altogether unsure just how to Account for the Archives. 

"Fenrii, all you are saying is contained Accounted for already, within the Fifth Tenet, which must also be the First."

Fenrii sighs once more, in resignation to the conclusion they always return to. "That of the Mystery. That we are never likely to know to whole extent of the Story."

 Bardlii has watched the remains of his pear float find its way through rocks and sticks, and for a moment fetched up, and then released again, and at last around a bend, and out of sight. "One can't see the whole book, while also reading it."

And they both surely knew that neither could know what it truly was they were striving to show. They had both long ago begun to wonder though whether they had always been Storied, since and until the Dawn of Records, and if so, then who was the author of the Dawn?



[^interrupted]: And here Fenrii's journal entry trailed away, quite all at once.

[^offRecord]: Noonstar made his own ad-hoc record here as well, purely as a point of process, and proceeded to assume it would never become part of any aggregate. It bears mentioning that Observators' ranks go quite past that of the 5th.

[^rangeAndLOS]: Range and line of sight are both quite crucial, when seeking to successfully sustain spells of obfuscation. You won't get that far though, getting an Observator of any rank to talk to you frankly about the mechanics of Hermetic magic - they do not align philosophically with most other remaining schools, which still consider the projection of fire and plague and wind and such to be all that magic was ever conceived to accomplish. Call them Observators, or, if you will, historians-at-large. This will get you further in their good graces. But I digress.
