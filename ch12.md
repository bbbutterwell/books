## Crossroads

*version 0505*

*Field Account #472*

*Fenrii Netherlight,*

*Observator, 2nd rank, HOO*

*Third Thirdsdaii, Autumn, WoM 121*

*Master Noonstar and I have been traveling slowly Seaward from Owl with the 77th Owlic Mule-borne, and we are soon to break camp on our fifth morning. There have been no great incidents, save for some spontaneous tax collecting, which is never that pleasant to observe, though to Owl's credit, its methods are far more intensely bureaucratic and paperwork-laden, than crudely intimidating, as in the days of old, or as in some neighbouring Regencies still.*

*This company of men is mostly young, and the majority have yet to see any fighting in the field. There are a few old grognards, and one or two of varied experience who seem to take some satisfaction in the exacting of tolls from travellers and labourers alike, for the use of the Kings Roads and Fields, whenever the opportunity arises. The company's captain, a middling man with a regal nose, named Nells (Nells being the man, and not the nose), turns a blind eye to this toll-taking only at times, and is mostly content to do what is needed to keep the men from any premature discontent. It is untrue that mutinies only happen at sea.* 

*And so, our traveling coffers are somewhat heftier already, and the men's spirits are high, since that will be where their Moondaii ciders will come from, along the long journey around and back again. We've left no fomenting revolts in our wake, as best my mentor and I are able to discern. I've seen worse patrol captains than Nells, and a few better ones too.*

*I have endeavoured dearly to practice my wanting crafts of Observation, and have asked Master Noonstar to inform me each time I become, even for a moment, too Storied in the eyes of the men. We have agreed for now not to count those occasions when the cleverest burro, whom we've named Hound, chooses to make it known to us that it can still tell what we're up to. It does not seem to care whether any of the soldiers do, and none of its kin seem to notice us at all, even when it is clearly on our scent. Hound, for now, is to be an anomaly, and also an opportunity to hone our finer skills with particular challenges. I am uncertain from from where his preternatural sense arises, as he is otherwise utterly nondescript among his kind.*

*I have managed to remain fully un-present to over three-quarters of the men now, for these past several days, and have begun, I think, to learn how to sink back again into the background more surely and suddenly, when occasions arise where I am perceived, and then recalled as having been met before, somewhere. Only two of the older men seem to be growing somewhat in their suspicions, each time we re-meet. Noonstar has suggested I simply remain opposite them in the camp for now, until I have mastered disappearing from the minds of the younger ones.*

*By Third Soondaii eve, we could see Owl only by its now-faint ambience in the evening sky, and by yesterday, the hills stood entirely between us and home, and we skirted the edge of the Bollburii Bog, which stretches clear to the Rightward Sea, though nothing but a fog fills one's vision, in all directions and at all times of day there - so none would ever know where the ocean was, until they had waded clear into it, up to their neck. We moved carefully along that stretch, staying toward the driest land when possible, as the boardwalks and bridges are forever in a state of rot. Every Owlic patrol's duty includes repairs of the King's Road, along the way. The captain ordered a few logs and planks and posts replaced here and there at first, but for the most part, we soldiered quickly on. Others would do their part, presumably, to keep the paths passable enough in that place. Few came this way anyhow, anymore. The Bogs, you see, are almost entirely new. They were once farmland, called the Bollberii Fields, not so long ago.*

*Bugbears were seen in the swampy ditches amid the fog, by several men, as we neared early eve - greater numbers than had been expected, and this was the point when the men no longer muled about so casually, trading shots of bravado and nonsense. Bugbears are not known to be all too brazen, unless they have the clear advantage in numbers - at least, Master Noonstar assures me, by a factor of six-to-one, or more. They did not appear to number more than triple our company, at their largest apparent count, though every hour we spent along the Bollburiis by the end of that day, more of them seemed to arrive out of the wetland, drawn by the news of our presence, perhaps, and the scent too, no doubt, of our many mules. Always though, approaching only to the fringes of where the fog would let us see them for certain - how many behind them, always unknown.*

*The captain wisely had us march straight through that night, and aside from one laborious and troubling long wade around a newly felled bridge, our surroundings and ourselves lit by torchlights alone, in the otherwise gloom - and after which, two mules were found to be missing, once we had reached the other side - we had no more worrisome encounters in that place. By the following morning, we had left the Bogs behind, along with a half-filled coffer of freshly collected tax, several tents, and the hapless mules that had carried them for us that far. Simply earned, and simply lost, as the old adage goes.*

*On the fourth day of our journey, yesterday, during a moderate and persistent rainfall, we were sheltering within a copse of low-slung Oddwoods, and that is when Master Bardlii overheard two soldiers talking, which then caught his attention, so that he called me over, and told me where to stand, so as not to be noticed. It was the older of the two, whom the younger called Riteweld, which had us both intrigued.*

*Riteweld, otherwise called Sir Ba* [^interrupted]

Junior Observator Netherlight is propped against a middle-sized Oddwood. He is making his Field Account for Third Thirdsdaii morning, Autumn, WoM 121. He is once again entirely unaware that his mentor is in the company, despite his having mentioned said mentor several times in the very journal entry he is currently writing. When he reviews it, he will recall for the seventh time since this trip began, that I have been here all along.

His *intention* is not the issue, it is entirely his *attention* which is his current challenge, and therefore, mine.

Netherlight is an all-too-willing pupil, but is far too caught up in not being caught, and so he misses things, and gets caught anyway. I will have to explain this to him, once again, in some other way. This is fine, as this is part of my role as Observator, fifth rank. I do not mind passing on what I can, when I'm able. Nonetheless, we have real work ahead of us, and Netherlight is about to commit to print the name of our first subject, which of course, can't be permitted to occur.

Naturally, this very ad-hoc observation, by me, will be stricken from all records, so as not to confuse the final, aggregate one. There is always some editing involved. I have in any event overused my personal pronouns. I would never wish this record to find its way into anything, and so it won't. 

I like fluffy clouds. My favourite colour is summer finch green. I should like to meet a real unicorn someday, I have several questions to ask. 

I sometimes wish that I did not know the precise day and time of my mortal demise.

Middling Observator, Bardlii Noonstar was sitting next to his Junior, Fenrii Netherlight, observing the man's narrative exposition of the previous days' Accounts, filled as it was with speculation and superfluous description and wandering syntaxes. [^offRecord]

There was a value to being verbose in one's Accounts, at times, and there was more often a greater one to being succinct. Bardlii's own Field Accounts of that same stretch of time and space, placed side-by-side with the one he was trying to follow now, while reading over Fenrii's shoulder, were of roughly equal length, in terms of words, but the former contained nothing but objective facts: precise quantities, times, weather conditions, notes on flora and fauna, the ages, heights, weights, and objectifiable traits of all 41 soldiers, fifty-two (once fifty-four) mules, and one captain, which comprised the entirety of their company (officially)... and several dozen additional quantities and records of variably similar worth. Not a thing one would read for pleasure, to be sure, and that was precisely the point. If you are writing for pleasure, you are being subjective, and that's not what history is intended to be.

Fenrii's Account, meanwhile, read like some tale told by tale-telling faerie folk, which are captured at times in Telling Tomes, as they are being told, and then often sold as curiosities to the idling nobility, and sometimes, the plainly under-employed.

Bardlii of course had kept his opinions of Fenrii's style of Accounting-taking to himself, all this time. It was one thing to wax poetic in personal letters, and road journals, and quite another to do so while doing the business of a wandering Accountant of deeds. 

It was, however, not his place to bend the Junior's practice into the shape of his own. The Administration back in Owl would decide itself to what extent Fenrii would be required to edit his material afterward, to fit within the permissible schemas defined by the Archive. The natural consequence of substituting hard fact with verbose fancy would be days and nights spent in gruelling effort to dredge forth minute recollections of all those missing details, long after the fact. There were, of course, techniques for this too, and none of them were particularly pleasant. Most, just simply intolerably dull. Fenrii would learn at least some things the hard way, as Bardlii had done himself. There was no other way to learn everything, but to learn some thing wrong the first time.

He watched as Fenrii meticulously recounted the *feeling* of watching taxation occur; the regality (not a subjective measurement, by any standard) of Captain Nells's nose; Observator exercises, practices, and conversations which by Owlic law must be redacted anyhow; mention of armed, Owlic patrols avoiding rather than dealing with Bugbear incursions (the whole point of arming a patrol is to deal with these things, after all); and then the impending mention of Sir Barnabas Riteweld, legendary knight of the Order of Elder Knights, and that was when Bardlii had to shut the whole thing down.

He put his finger on young Observator's journal, and when Fenrii's quill got to where the finger was, Fenrii near jumped from his own skin.

"The *Fate*!" he yelled, and a full half of the company of soldiers, who were not so spread out as not to notice a wizard in their midst shout loudly in fright out of nowhere, turned at once to see what the issue was, and who was shouting, and three of them even made moves for their weapons.

Bardlii grabbed Fenrii by his shirt scruff and pulled him around the side of the tree, and they locked eyes, and Fenrii recalled who Bardlii was (once again), and they both slow counted to three. Then Bardlii stuck his head out, and saw the men had gone back to what they were doing, though two of them continued their conversation with their hands upon the pommels of their swords. He scanned around for older two men who had become subconsciously suspicious of Fenrii's un-presence, and saw, thankfully, they were at the far end of the camp, simply eyeing the other men, and wondering what had caused the stir.[^rangeAndLOS]

[^interrupted]: And here Fenrii's journal entry trailed away, quite all at once.

[^offRecord]: Noonstar made his own ad-hoc record here as well, purely as a point of process, and proceeded to assume it would never become part of any aggregate. It bears mentioning that Observators' ranks go quite past that of the 5th.

[^rangeAndLOS]: Range and line of sight are both quite crucial, when seeking to successfully sustain spells of obfuscation. You won't get that far though, getting an Observator of any rank to talk to you frankly about the mechanics of Hermetic magic - they do not align philosophically with most other remaining schools, which still consider the projection of fire and plague and wind and such to be all that magic was ever conceived to accomplish. Call them Observators, or, if you will, historians-at-large. This will get you further in their good graces. But I digress.
