# Love and Anger

*version 0424*

The fourth thing the voice ever said to me was *You can call me science if you want to. Science is good if it's scientific*.

What did the voice mean by that? Isn't that the only way science can be? Scientific? That's what I thought. But then I thought about it some more and now I think I understand what it meant.

Here's one example. We used science to invent plastic. You could say that plastic is proof that we have science. But then dumping plastic into the sea so it ruins all the habitats everywhere is not scientific thinking. Atoms can be used to make power to run your town's lights. Science. Atoms can be used to make bombs that cause everybody to hate each other, and the planet to get worse, instad of better. Unscientific. Science is good, as long as it's scientific. The voice wasn't wrong, you can use science like somebody who doesn't know jack about science. I think that's probably ironic.

I first learned about the word ironic from a pop song that Ani used to sing a lot, before we had to sell our turntable and records to get me in music lessons, which just didn't take. I don't have a musical bone in my body, and I tried to tell Ani that but she just wouldn't listen. I miss listening to her sing. She wasn't great at it. Maybe she would be better now, I don't know. She used to sing more when I was younger and we still had a record player.

There's a lot of irony in the world, I think, but I'm not too sure I could point it all out to you accurately because people tell me that song isn't about irony at all, so now I'm misusing the word all the time, so mostly I just avoid using it so I don't come off like I don't know about irony. Niall says that's what makes the song the best song about irony, because the song itself is ironic.

My favourite songs to hear Mother Ani sing are songs by ABBA and songs by the musician Jeff Lynne, who is her favourite person, after her only daughter - who is me, as you know. I found a lot of letters to the musician Jeff Lynne in the attic back that first year with Bee when I started investigating Ani's past, and I had known she liked the musician Jeff Lynne, but I didn't know she had written him letters and song lyrics, and then why she never sent them. I asked her later and she told me I shouldn't have read those but then there wasn't anything embarrassing in them, she was just young and really liked a musician and wanted him to know that his music had helped her get through tough times.

Jeff Lynne made a lot of dance music and a lot of not-dance music and sometimes it was the music you didn't expect would get you through tough times that got my Mom through tough times, when she didn't expect it. If you think about it, that means Jeff Lynne got me through a lot of tough times, even when I didn't know it - even before I was born.

Maybe Jeff Lynne is one reason I even had the choice to be, in the first place, I don't know. How can a person know something like that? I think I should write to musician Jeff Lynne and let him know that he got Ani and me through some tough times, and maybe other people too, because of that. If my story gets somebody through tough times, then that's Jeff Lynne's doing too. He should know that. I'd want to know. That's why it's hard to tell where a person's story actually stops - because it really doesn't. It keeps going in other people's stories. This is why I'm already taking so long telling mine. I don't know who to stop with.

I didn't respond to the voice that time, when it told me I could call it Science if I wanted to. So what? What did I care what it was ok with? I'd call it whatever I damn wanted, it was my voice. I was still mad at it then, because of the third thing the voice ever said to me, which was the shortest thing it ever said to me so far. Sometimes I think it was the meanest thing it ever said too, other times, I'm not sure it was being mean. I'm not going to talk about that until much later in my story though. Right now I'm trying to keep all the sad things from being in my head at the same time.

Last Winter was shorter than I had hoped. I'm not always a fan of Winter but I wanted this last one to last forever. I did everything I could think of to get Bee out on the ice but she never liked skating after that time she fell through and I suppose you can't blame somebody for not wanting to skate after something like that. It was just her legs that fell through and she had only just stepped onto the ice, but it was the ocean so I can imagine her imagination got a good scare.

She said it was so cold and it happened so fast. I said yeah but we're on the pond now, and we'd only do a couple of laps and she just said look Maevis, I'm too old now, I can't keep my balance, I'm afraid of falling, and it's just not fun for me anymore. My skating days are over. I'll watch you. Go on, it's ok.

She had brought hot chocolate and she had her self-heating cushion and extra scarves and I could tell she had come to stay, and stay warm. Just not skate. I got it. I skated around a bit while Bee watched and I waved at her and I couldn't cry. I just wanted that Winter to last forever. Ever since I saw how good she was at being an old lady, which was about the second day I knew her, I had always wanted us both to be old ladies together someday. But I knew that couldn't happen. Time travel is not possible.

I have a .22 caliber rifle in the tea cabinet and I know how to clean it and shoot it and I've shot it in anger twice, but not criminally. Officer Hope Flowers had to show up once though because when you shoot a .22 on Sisters Island, the sound carries across the water, all the way into town, to Water Street at least.. I didn't know anything about that when I was doing shooting practice that first Summer I stayed with Bee. On days when I needed to practice my aim, I waited until she went down for her nap and then I'd grab that thing out of the cabinet and go to the orchard and set up cans and practice my aim. I shot loads of cans. Not bottles, I didn't want glass everywhere that the critters might cut themselves on. But cans and cereal boxes were fair game.

And then there were a couple of incidents, where I shot the .22 in anger but I'll save that story for later. Anyway, after a while that Fall, Officer Flowers called the house and said could he come over for a visit so I said sure, Bee was sleeping but he could come over and he said he'd be over the next low tide which was the next morning, kind of early. We didn't have a lot of visitors but most of them would just walk across the causeway when the tide was still going out, once it was above water again. Then they had the least risk of getting stuck on the island. Sometimes visitors stay too long and have to sleep over but Bee tended to shoo them out so that wouldn't happen and I tend to stick with that tradition too. People might think it's rude when I say, you have to go now, but really I just don't want them getting swept out to sea, or having to sleep in the guest room when I don't feel like making people breakfast the next morning.

When Office Flowers came over the next morning, he and Bee talked for a bit and then he asked to talk to me and that's when I learned the whole town of Elders Falls and the people in the settlement across the Bay and drivers on the Mainland Road and hikers on Elders Mountain had all been listening to my target practice. They had even talked about it on the radio. That's when I decided I need to fix old Bently's radio, because I was missing out on important news from the nearby town, like reports of gunfire. I guess most people figured out it was coming from the island - it wasn't hard to triangulate. Sound really carries across water, did you know that? I promised not to shoot the .22 anymore and after that I only took it out when there was a big storm and the water was all choppy and people would be inside and not expecting to hear gunshots, or maybe mistake them for lightning. It was during a lightning storm when I shot the .22 in anger for the first time. I guess I'll make that a cliffhanger rather than a spoiler. I'm trying something new with my storytelling.

The second time I fired the .22 in anger was after Bee's funeral. I shot a tree, a bunch of times. I just picked a nice one and I unloaded on it until there was a big piece of bark missing. I felt bad afterward. It's a good tree, it hadn't deserved to be shot. Trees are tough. .22 caliber rounds are pretty small. I wouldn't want to get shot by one, but if I were a tree, I might not mind, I don't know. Maybe I would. It took a half box of .22 caliber rounds before I wasn't angry anymore. I didn't hear any news about the gunfire on the radio that week. I kept finding boxes of food and flowers left at the dock and the Mainland Road shoulder near the causeway gate all that week though. Bee was dead, so they weren't for her. The town have left those things for me. That's what Liz told me. Even though they probably heard me shooting in anger, they still brought me cookies and flour and flowers.

Everybody is mad at me today. Do you ever have one of those weeks where everybody you know is mad at you, or mad at each other, and it's all for different reasons? I've been curled up under a blanket in the sewing room upstairs, where there's a cot I keep in case I need to curl up under a blanket in the second-smallest room in the house, not counting the half-bathroom off the mudroom on the first floor. Not counting the half-bathroom off the mudroom, the smallest room in the house is the pantry, which is off the kitchen. The second-smallest is the sewing room upstairs, like I said. I started calling it the Curling Room that first Fall I stayed with Bee, when Mother Ani was supposed to have picked me up already, but had decided to stay Out West or Up North or whatever.

Whatever. I like small rooms for curling up under blankets in. The Curling Room is where I curl up when I need all the thoughts in my head to be quiet. Everybody is mad at me today.

All the madness started when I fell off the roof, because I used masking tape to fix the ladder, which I should have known wasn't going to work. Actually I knew it wasn't going to work. I'm not sure why I tried fixing a ladder with masking tape. I'm not that bad at using tape, usually. I've gotten pretty good at fixing things, ever since I had to fix the radio that time when I was younger. From that point on, I started fixing all kinds of stuff. Bee's island was full of broken things that need fixing.

I should have known the masking tape wasn't going to work. Even if I used almost two whole rolls. Masking tape isn't for structural repairs. Neither is Duct tape, really, but everybody knows duct tape can fix things that it was never legally designed to fix. But masking tape on a ladder, that's a dumb idea.

So the first person who got mad at myself was me. My ankle was twisted and it really hurt but what hurt the most was that I tried to fix a ladder with masking tape, and then I hurt myself, and then I got angry at myself. Then I called Normand to yell at him because I was mad that he left me with that giant ladder, and forgot I wasn't huge like he was, so how was I supposed to move it? But then he got mad at me, because Claudette got mad at him too, because I guess he had told me he'd help me with the shingles on the weekend, and I was just supposed to leave the ladder on the ground where he left it, until he came back on the weekend. But he hadn't told Claudette that, and I wasn't about to tell her that I had forgot that he had told me that part, about waiting until the weekend. I just wanted the shingles fixed so I could feed Liz muffins and tell her she was like a sister to me. Love make you forget things, and sometimes even put yourself in danger.

Claudette got so angry at Normand when she heard he had left the ladder and didn't stay to help with the shingles, and I tried to fix the shingles by myself, and then nearly broke my leg. Normand's angry with me for throwing him under the bus. I can tell. He wanted me to remember that at the right time, so Claudette wouldn't be mad at him, but I was too mad at him because I was mad at myself for using masking tape when it was a duct tape job, so Claudette had to stay angry with Normand, and Normand had to stay angry with me.

But that's not all. After Claudette and norm had come over and set me up in the living room with blankets and pillows and ice cream, and then argued more upstairs when they thought I couldn't hear, and then left because I told them a thousand ties I was ok and I just wanted to be alone, then Liz showed up a day early with Harry and not Peotr. I think Claudette called Liz and told her to come over and check on me. Claudette's always doing things like that because she loves everybody she meets and she acts like everybody's mother.

Liz and Harry had walked the causeway to get to the island. I should probably just say so you know from now on that usually when we have visitors to the island - I mean, when I do - usually they just wait for the low tide and walk the causeway. Sometimes we use the boat but there's only one boat so it's usually on the island where I am. Only Normand drives across the causeway, and never when Claudette is with him. She'll tell him she's walking and he can drive if he wants. He likes driving on the causeway because he likes mild adventure.

Officer Hope Flowers also has a zodiac hid in the bushes just up the Mainland Road that the town police know about in case there's an emergency, and they need to get over here, but I'm not supposed to know about that. Once, some scientists from a secret science organization visited the island by helicopter, but that only happened once. Most of the time, when I tell you somebody came to visit the island, I mean they waited for low tide and walked the causeway. That's the normal way to get here.

When Liz and Harry the Light Bright got here, Liz had wet eyes right when I answered the door, and I thought she was upset that I had fallen off the roof, but that turned out not to be the reason. I told her I was ok and then she gave me a look that has taken me literally years to understand. I used to never ever understand how people could say things without coming out and saying them. But Liz taught me. I knew she had been crying, and when she gave me that look that Liz has, I knew it wasn't because I fell off the roof. I don't take that sort of stuff personally. I knew she would have cried if I had died from falling off the roof. That's enough for me.

She had brought me a pizza but it was cold but that's ok I said, I put it in the fridge and then I came back and told Harry to go catch a Gnome in the backyard and he already Gnew where I kept the Gnome Gnets and so off he went. I was pretty sure he wouldn't catch one because they're really fast, and I'm faster than Harry, who's only six. Liz doesn't believe in Gnomes, she thinks it's just a thing I made up to keep keep Harry running around in the backyard until he gets tired. She calls me a genius sometimes. That's nice of her, but I'm not lying about the Gnomes.

Then I sat down on the couch with her and gave her a tea and that's when she started crying for real. I have never seen Liz cry like that - like, really cry. That's what sobbing is. When you're crying so hard it causes your whole body to shake, like you're trying to throw up your sadness, but you can't. That's sobbing. I've never done that, so I don't know what it feels like. I was worried it might hurt, that's what it looked like - like it would hurt. I asked Liz if it hurt, and that just seemed to make it worse.

I don't do hugs well, I think I've mentioned that already. I'm bad at starting them and usually it's a side-hug, and not too long, but I don't know why I did it, I just did it. I opened my arms up, which is how you start a hug, and then liz just glommed onto me and I just hugged her. I hugged her while she sobbed. My sister whom I never had was hurt. Liz Brighter, who is my hero, who is the mother of Bubba Pancakes, who is my Favourite Boy - my first best friend. Liz was hurt. For the first time in my life, I knew what it must feel like to really cry, because she was holding me so tight while she was crying, and my body felt like it was crying too, and our hearts felt like they were touching, and then I had tears all over my face, and I don't know how long we both did that. I just don't know. I don't know what we were crying about. I was thinking about Bee and how I wish Bee were there to hug Liz and make it better, because Bee wasn't great at hugs but she was better than I was. I miss Bee so much.

After a while I said her tea was getting cold and Liz laughed and she had snot all over her face and I really don't enjoy looking at that sort of thing so I went to get a paper towel in the kitchen and my legs were all wobbly, but my body felt light. I felt like I was half the weight I was before Liz came over. I must have stood at the sink for a long time, because Liz came in and stood next to me and put her head on my shoulder, and I just felt light. I didn't know crying could make you feel better. Why hadn't anybody told me? That's a stupid thing not to tell somebody. I'm almost twenty-seven years old. I should have known.

Harry was running around like a madman out there, swinging the Gnome Gnet at everything he could see and at nothing at all, and I stood there feeling light and feeling Liz's head on my shoulder and then my head on her head, and the island felt like Sisters Island to me, for the first time.

And then Liz told me that Peotr had left her, and I told her that didn't surprise me, because he tried to kiss me once.

I'm in the Curling Room, beneath an old blanket that still smells like Bee. Everybody is mad at me today.
