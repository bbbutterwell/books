## Departure

*version 0504*

Dagnett,

Hello, my friend. I hope the Archive is treating you well. I dropped by the upper level to see if I could catch you before you descended into the depths for however many days or weeks you tend to take down there, but I was an hour too late, so I am writing you this note to let you know where I've disappeared to, for a time. I've been given a mission. I am not permitted to divulge where in the Realms I am being sent at this time, but they've said nothing in particular about staying tight-lipped as to the reason. In fact, the rumour I believe is being allowed to spread gradually within the halls of the Observatory and the Arbitorium both. We might be in luck; our careers might not be destined to be for nought, as we once thought.

There has been a mysterious benefactor recently come forth, it is said, offering a large sum of silver to the Executors, on the condition it be used solely in the production of a single update to the Short Account of Known Heroes. Perhaps you will have heard this news already, but I was too excited not to tell you myself, as well.

Although it is commonly understood that the Owlic Code is, under the right conditions, open to modification, no Minister I have ever discussed this with has been able to clarify what those conditions might be, and the occasions of it happening in the living memory of any of them can be counted on a single hand. It seems to me that, regarding this secret, only the Executors themselves hold the key.

Apparently, a good deal of silver in some cases might be enough to warrant an update to the Code. I am, on the one hand, a bit disillusioned by this discovery, and on the other, not terribly surprised. One can't, in any case, look a gift-mule in the mouth. We have been reactivated, if only for a single new issue. Perhaps, if our job is done well, others may be allowed to follow. Even if not, then *our* new issue will forevermore be the most recent one, for future generations to regard as the last example of the noblest work of interpretative history the world has ever known: that of the definition of what is required to be deemed a Hero, in the eyes of Owl. 

I cannot imagine a greater calling, than to revive the Realmic zeal for the uncommon character, who are so sorely needed these days, as you know.  

I am quite giddy to get myself on the road. I haven't been issued my traveling maps yet, but once I have, I will be well equipped, to locate our first subject.

Curiously, they present in a most common and unassuming form - that of a common hooded rat. I believe we may be dealing with a Green Wizard of great craft, here, or perhaps one of the Fey-blooded, rumoured still to exist in places. I was entirely underwhelmed at first viewing the creature in the crystal, which must only mean that I am in for a great surprise, when I finally meet them. 

I have been asked to update existing records of last-known Heroes along the way; whether they still live, if they are still quantifiably Heroic, and what additional deeds should need to be appended to their respective registries. I have been issued two items from the Stores, to aid me in my travels abroad, which I might tell you more about in a future update.

I look forward to meeting with you on my return, old friend, though I can't say when I might be back in Owl. In years past, the Account as you know was updated every second year, and so I will endeavour to complete the task well within that time frame, to increase our chances of being reinstated into active service once again. You have my oath, I will do my very best.

Take great care in the Archives. I have heard rumours of Gnomish unrest, an increase in the population of Grand Rats from the depths. Watch your surroundings, and seek fresh air frequently, although I know the Booknard clan is quite famous for needing surprisingly little of that. You are nonetheless still flesh and blood, my friend. Do see the sun now and then - the books will all be there when you return, I can almost assure you.

Until some other time soon,

Your friend,

Bardlii

Road Journal, 

Bardlii Noonstar,

Observator, 4th rank, HOO

Second Soonday, Autumn 72, WoM 121

I am a single day's mule ride out of the Capital, traveling with a contingent of soldiers tasked with patrolling the Kings Road, left-wise, through the Norlund Wood, to the Cape of Gareth and along the Iced Coast, and eventually back again, the long way. They will be gone a good number of fortnights, but I will not be following them for long - I part ways with the company in the town of Somedruthers, some days ride from here. 

I have never been out of the Capital. I have envisioned it in my mind, every day of my life, at least for a few moments, when I can spare them. From the town, I will head Seaward through the Norlund and bend right, until I encounter the trail known as the Hillsnake. This begins a long and winding upward journey, and protocol does not permit me to document in advance where I will go from there, so as not to endanger or warn my quarry unduly.

I have brought two enhanced items from the Stores with me, to aid me on my journeys. I can only believe that I have chosen wisely. The rest is with the Fate.

This endeavour cannot be dismissed as a frivolous expense, as some have already seen fit to protest openly within the halls of the Trunk. They are either afflicted by jealousy, or else a lack of vision. I am aware, like most of my colleagues in the twin Ministries of the Observatory and the Arbitorium, of the significance of the task.

There are none in the Realms, I will well wager, who do not in some measure aspire to the ranks of Heroship - though more than most consider the road too long, and the cost of walking it far too great. Known Heroes, since the dawn of history, have been drawn from those select few who possess the rare mettle to aspire to it, and then proceed to do so. 

Yet without the adoration of the masses, and the recognition of the State, even these are as likely to remain wallowing in obscurity, as they are to rise to their own potentials. This is the nature of Folk, as we know- to be driven or coerced toward this way of action or that, by the balance of forces within and outside of themselves. 

Owl itself was founded upon that wisest of insights: that the deepening of our knowledge of the inner workings of the hearts and minds of Folk would lead, invariably, to the final, perfect, self-reflecting Law which will best govern societies of mortal hearts and minds, at scale. The carrot and stick which are the mantles and sentences of Adoration and Contempt are of such fundamental function to these laws, that they bear oft-repeating, for being so obvious and uncontroversial, as to be in danger of easy dismissal - and forgotten altogether, at our great and collective peril. 

It is a good mantra, that a Person will act to be less a Villain than a Hero, if there is known to be, in essence, something in it for them, one way or the other. This is a good thing - it gives Owl all levers, and the means to pull them too, to produce a better citizenry, which will in turn create a better Owl, for All.

I consider this the perfect age and assignment to have been created for! I am fortunate to bear witness to the unlocking, perhaps in my own lifespan, of every remaining secret of the Spirited Beast, and the keys to its right management. Owl is the Alchemist that will concoct a new age of peace upon this world - its citizenry is both the reagents, and also the afflicted subject, seeking to be made whole again.

May the Fate guide me in the choices which follow my others made to date,

B. Noonstar,

*In avid search of the next Known Heroes of Great Renown*

Bardlii Noonstar puts a flourish on the finishing period of his latest self-inspiring journal entry, and puts his travelling quill carefully back into its leathern case, snapping it closed. He has propped himself upon a large, flat stone, well removed from the bustle of the soldiers, who go about the business of securing the mules and drawing lots for who gets to post the first watch that night, and who gets to start the drinking early. The Pale Eye is still over the horizon, though it is now touching the tree line. Somewhere far beyond the Norlund Wood, the Seas await it - the World's sun will need a good bath by then. Travelling the Sky every day, is hard and sweaty work, for a Star.

A young soldier has wandered close to the stone where Bardlii sits. The man does not acknowledge the Observator,  but begins relieving himself in the grass close by. Bardlii watches the man silently, wondering what town he has hailed from, and whether he chose his profession, or whether his profession chose him. The soldier has won the right to first ciders, and is getting his drinking and pissing in early, knowing he'll need to be sober my the time the Burning Moon winks at them over the distant mountains. 

For most of the deepest night in Allegoriia, at least in the Autumn season, the only light one can see by is that of the stars. When the sky is clear of clouds, this can be quite enough. 

Otherwise, the night is as dark as darkness can be. There will be fires lit along the perimeter of the camp, though the real dangers for this company will not likely appear until they are well away from the City's gaze, and deep into the Norlund Wood. 

"Fenrii, please stop, I'm trying to think", Bardlii Noonstar says at once, brow furrowed. The soldier does not even react to the Observator's voice - but finishes his business, and quickly stuffs his -"

"*Fenrii. Enough.*", Bardlii is looking at me now, and I suppose I had better stop. I put away my parchment.

---

Fenrii, though hidden behind a suitably large Ironiioak, and being a good two-dozen strides away from Bardlii - far enough, he had assumed (though incorrectly) to be able to go unnoticed - had nonetheless become unfortunately Storied, and so slunk out from behind the tree, unsure then where to stand, or what to do with his hands. He had not planned to be put on the spot, and into the plot. But it had happened again.

Bardlii regarded the young Observator from his sitting stone. He had been trying to ignore the young man's presence for the entirety of the trip from Owl (which was still quite visible in the near distance, being such a sprawl upon such a mountain as it was), but could not bring himself any longer to pretend Fenrii was not there. He had tried to be polite, but the Junior Observator was doing everything wrong, and Bardlii was apt to say something less polite, the longer he let it go. He motioned for the young man to come over, but Fenrii stood by the ironiioak, among the tall grass, shifting his weight from one foot to the next, looking a bit defeated.

"Well, what are you standing there for? I'm not about to un-see you now." said Bardlii, "You're part of the story, you might as well come over. You look silly standing there. Besides that, you are standing beneath an Elder Bees nest. Unwise." Bardlii motioned impatiently with his hand again, for the young man to come over. He disliked inefficiency. The pause was inefficient. He needed to be asleep in one hour and ten-to-fifteen moments. He had dreaming to do.

Fenrii looked up and saw the large, perfectly round, leathern sphere hanging in the lower branches of the great tree, exactly above his head. It was not so much the Elder Bees one had to worry about, as the weight and velocity of their nest when it finally chose to fall. Larger men than Fenrii had died that way. It was not at all common, of course, but there were certainly one or two verified reports, from over the years. 

He shuffled away from the danger, through the tall grasses toward Bardlii, slouching in self-pity as he did so. How long had the Middling Observator known he had been standing there?

"I knew you were in the company as we were leaving the main City gate." Bardlii responded to the unvoiced question, as he motioned for the man to sit on the flat stone next to his. It was considerably more squat, so Fenrii had to cross his legs to sit upon it, and it was not much better than sitting on the ground. He looked up at Bardlii, a pained expression on his face.

"Please stop feeling sorry for yourself." Bardlii said, as a soldier strode past him, carrying a heavy saddlebag, nodding only to Fenrii on the way by. "Half of our company has noticed you at one point or another, though most forget a few moments later, to your credit."

"I am a failure as an Observator." Fenrii had cut right to the heart of his matter, his head in his hands.

Bardlii sighed, and shook his. "No, you missed my compliment. I said I knew you were in the company *as we were leaving* the main City gate. I did not know how long you had been with us prior to that point. Would you like to tell me that, or do you prefer to keep it to yourself? I understand either way. I am offering to give you feedback on your technique."

Fenrii had slipped into the company's presence just *after* they had left the city gate, in fact. Either Master Noonstar had known Fenrii's intentions prior to his having acted on them himself, or else the Middling Observator wished for Fenrii to think that.

"I would not lie to you, Fenrii, especially about my own limitations." 

"Are you always in my mind, like that?" he said. *Is that how our world is,* he thought.

Bardlii felt sorry in that moment, and withdrew from the surface of Fenrii's mind. It was an occupational hazard, to invade another's, without meaning to. "I apologize, I will keep to myself, as a professional courtesy. You may, of course, continue to try and glean my thoughts. It's good practice. I am a bit harder to read than most, you'll find, and most are hard enough to read for many more."

Fenrii noted then a subtle change in how the air touched the skin around his neck, and wondered if that was a clue as to who was now no longer in his head. He tried to read Bardlii's expression, to determine if Bardlii had heard him think this too, but Bardlii simply looked back at him, as if challenging him to answer that for himself.

Bardlii's face broke into a grin. He had a good smile - it was genuine, and never condescending, unlike his words might sometimes sound. "It's hard, isn't it? I remember. You'll get there." 

Fenrii picked idly at the dirt, flicking tiny stones into the air. "How many of the soldiers have seen me then?"

"eight, maybe ten. About half the company. What does it matter? Your aim is for *not one* to see you. Until then, even one is too many. It might as well be a thousand." He leaned forward and restated, "*You'll get there.*"

"I am not so sure. I believe this calling is for those who are made with the gift." Fenrii caught himself, and quickly added, "That is, I don't have the same gift that you do. I might have been meant for something else."

Bardlii considered this. "Maybe so. Maybe you were made for something more. Had you thought of that?"

"Something more than being an Observator?" Fenrii gave Bardlii a curious look. "That's a curious thing to say. Isn't the journaling of Heroics the greatest calling there is?"

"I won't dignify that question with response. I am frankly surprised you asked it."

Fenrii thought about it for a moment. Of course. "Of course, I meant after being a *Known Hero*, I meant it is the second greatest calling."

"Is that what you meant?" Bardlii scratched his chin. One of the company's more inquisitive burros had been slowly sauntering over to where the Observators were sitting, and it began to sniff around Bardlii's stone. Bardlii gave Fenrii a look, and did not move or turn to regard the beast. He merely held a finger to his lips, signalling the his Junior to be still. The burro began to nuzzle the stone right next to Bardlii's leg.

Fenrii's eyes grew wide, but he made no sound. The two waited as the burro continued to examine the stone, and then dug a bit at the dirt around it, its tail swishing as it attempted to solve some mystery in its burro mind. Fenrii held his breath, and almost imagined then that Bardlii was trying not to laugh. Soon, he was stifling one of his own. He gave Bardlii a silent, questioning look. Bardlii just shook his head, ever so slowly, and waited.

At last, the burro heard one of its kin whinny, and it turned lazily, its tail hitting Bardlii full in the face, and it sauntered away. 

At last both Observators let out a slow breath. Bardlii spoke first, "*None* in this company has yet to notice I have been with them all this time - even for a moment, as far as I'm aware - except for that damned burro, right there. It has been able to see me twice now - And it is continuously curious as to where I've gone, even when it can't."

Fenrii felt incredulous. How could that be?

"Don't be so surprised. And no, I am not in your mind now, you just wear all of your thoughts everywhere over your face. Why does it surprise you that the baser beasts are more in tune with their surroundings? That is their sole occupation, after all - to know their environment. They are not concerned with when they will be able to get drunk next, or how many silver coins their neighbour may have hidden in their boot, or who they hope the next Regent might be or not be... or whether they've chosen their career wisely, or made a grave mistake."

Fenrii wondered if his flushing face was visible in this light, which was now approaching dusk. He imagined that it was. He was overwhelmed at times with the questioning of himself. "Still, you have been at this profession for - "

"Twenty-six years. Yes. I fail too, Fenrii. More than you might think. It may not be in my professional interest to make that well known, but it happens, I'm telling you now. You are in for a lifespan of learning. Don't fool yourself that you will ever have mastered anything. You never will. Mastery is not for mortals."

"But you are -"

"- *also* mortal, like *you* are." Bardlii's expression made Fenrii known that subject was closed.

"I understand."

"I'm sure you feel that you understand some things. Let me know what it feels like, if you ever know for certain that you understand everything. I should like to know what that's like."

The two sat for a moment, the younger uncertain what question was most needed next, and the somewhat-older, waiting to see what that would be.

Then the fireflies alit, all at once. [^fireflies]

Bardlii startled, having never seen fireflies up close before. He had only seen them vaguely as glowing clouds, and only in the strongest of spyglasses, and always from a great distance, and only twice in his whole life. He looked about him everywhere now, as the flitting lights rose as one from the tall grass, and the soldiers nearby shouted a greeting, many considering it a sign of great Fate to have the fireflies visit them so early in their journey. One of the younger men began trying to catch a firefly with their helmet, but that never works. The company had not really entered the dangerous part of their journey, and were still relaxed, and easily amused.

Fenrii watched Bardlii for a while, as his Senior observed the fireflies as they wandered lazily about, winking in and out, at times alone, and other times in patterns, as though they were telling stories, or sharing news. "You have never seen fireflies before." Fenrii observed.

Bardlii continued to watch the patterns - they were more intricate and meaningful than he had imagined. There seemed to be several independent groups, and a hierarchy, he felt... though it was complex. "No. I have only heard of things outside of the capital City. I have never left the gates. Sometimes I use a spyglass to catch glimpses."

Fenrii had suspected that Master Noonstar was an eccentric of sorts - many Observators were - but he hadn't considered him to have been a City shut-in. "Never in twenty-seven years? I... I am -"

"Surprised? Disillusioned?" Bardlii smiled again. He was taking out his field notebook, and wondering where he had put his drawing coals. It would be difficult to sketch things so bright with things so dark. He would sketch the night and the trees and the mules and the soldiers instead - the fireflies themselves would just be the absence of any darkness, among all of that. "I understand. I have been training all of this time for this opportunity." Bardlii opened his sketchbook, and gave Fenrii a stern look. "I am *not* ever fully ready, Fenrii - but I am *ready enough, anyway*. We have our mission, and it's a worthy one. We're ready." Bardlii unwrapped his sketching coal and began to capture fireflies, the absence of darkness, among all other things.

Fenrii had seen fireflies fourteen times in his life by then. Maybe fifteen. His memory was not perfect, which was a shame, as it would need it to be. Wouldn't it? He was an Observator - his purpose was to observe - *for the Realm to bear witness, for the All*. He would need to recall things accurately. Wouldn't he? Like, *exactly* how many times he had seen fireflies, and which one of the mules he should be the most careful to conceal himself from, and where not to stand in case of falling nests... and what qualities to look for, to know that you're seeing a Hero.

Fenrii chose to sleep on his too-many concerns, and simply observe his Middling mentor, as Bardlii tried to capture the essence of fireflies in flight, seen by mortal eyes for the very first time, at night. The Burning Moon, called Tear, was at its low zenith, and the clouds had all departed, and every single star came out to attend to the fireflies' dance, and the lights of Owl were still there too. 

And it was the brightest, clearest night that Fenrii would ever know.

[^fireflies]: In Allegoriia, this is how fireflies work - when they come on, they all come on at once. It's quite lovely, really, though often startling as well, at times, as one might imagine.
