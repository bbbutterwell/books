## Arrival

*yy0410*

When I was growing up, Mother Ani told me that Sisters Island was called that because when her dad died, he left the island to his sisters. I now know that's not true, because I found a map of the Elders Bay region in the archive, which is two rooms in the basement of the Elders Falls library. On that map, Sisters Island was still called Sisters Island. The map was over 150 years old. So that can't be right.

I once asked Mom why she lied about the island being named after Bee and her sisters, but she pulled a Bee and changed the subject by asking me if I wanted to order pizza. Of course I wanted to order pizza - I love ordering pizza. Who doesn't?

I call that "pulling a Bee" because that's what Aunt Bee (who is actually my Great Aunt) used to do too, whenever I asked too many questions all at once - or the wrong question at an inconvenient time. Bee was good at baking, so I got fed all sorts of stuff when I was being curious around her. Mom can't cook or bake but there's a pizza place right in town and they deliver right to the dock and so that works pretty well too, for everybody involved. Like I said, I like pizza, and people often find my questions more inconvenient than ordering pizza.

So, there's another mystery I haven't solved, after, what, fifteen years? More than that, now. I met Bee when I was really young but then I didn't see her for years, and then Mom brought me to stay with Bee on Sisters Island, just before my thirteenth birthday, when I was eleven. You're going to maybe have to take notes, I don't know. My story has a lot of mysteries in it. I'll get back to the gnomes, I promise - they're somewhere in the middle. So, I don't know when Sisters Island was actually called Sisters Island...or, I suppose, how old Bee and her Sisters actually are. How old they would be now, I mean.

If you were here having tea with me I might just ask you what you'd like to know, about my life, but you aren't, so I'll just keep going. I'll talk about Niall next.

Niall was a friend I had for a few years. I met him in the principal's office in grade six or something. I was in trouble for handing in my homework sideways. This is what I called it when I did homework on time, but not the homework I was asked to do. Niall was in the principal's office because... actually I don't know why. I never asked him why he was there. Niall never really talked about himself very much, and he didn't really ask people much about themselves either. He was just interested in what he found interesting, and that was that. He was interesting. What else am I supposed to say about him? He was a good friend, I'm not sure what he's up to now. Probably something interesting.

Liz is still my best friend - I've known her for as long as I've known Niall. I knew who she was before I met Niall, but I met her in person after I met Niall. I think she was my friend before Niall was, though. I kind of met them both around the same time. It depends on how you look at it. Liz is great. She believes in god, but she doesn't mind that I call god just Science. I think she understands what I mean.

Liz is helping me repaint Bee's house. It's mine now, which I still am not sure how to feel about. We painted the kitchen pale yellow. I wanted to paint it black but Liz said why not yellow and when I thought about it, that seemed to make sense too, so I said sure. This was only two days ago - the day before the voice told me to write my story. I think when somebody gives me a good idea, I'm pretty good at seeing that it's a good idea. I think that means I'm easy-going.

You might be wondering if I have Aspergers, or something like that. I'm not sure if you are, or if I do. I've been asked that three times, which is why I'm wondering. I asked Ani (I call Mom Ani and Ani Mom, it's the same person) if she thought I should get tested, and she got upset. I think she was worried if I had something, she'd have to feel guilty about it. I wouldn't hold it against her, but honestly I don't know if I want to know. This is just how I am. I have something, I know that. Everybody has something though, so I'm not sure that it matters, as long as you're kind.

When I saw Bee last, she said, Maevis, you have to promise me something, and I said, Bee, what is it? She said, you have to promise me to take care of Sisters Island, and the houses, and the dock, and the old orchard and all of that. Feed the crows sometimes, but not too much, or they'll stop learning how to take care of themselves. Will you promise me you'll do that? I said, Bee, what are you, dying or something? I was joking. I like joking with Bee. Bee didn't say anything, or tell me pish-posh, and she didn't offer me muffins either, and I said, oh.

I wanted to cry. I wanted to cry, that's how much I wanted to cry. Bee knew it - I just knew she knew it. She held my hand, but it didn't help. I didn't cry. Bee and I had another week, almost, and we said other things, and there wasn't a big goodbye speech, and she passed away in her sleep. I found her, she was dead. She seemed relaxed. Her forehead didn't have that wrinkle it had always had, even when she was laughing about something. I never really noticed the wrinkle in her forehead until she was dead, and it wasn't there anymore. She had a beautiful, smooth forehead. It was like magic. And we buried her the next day, on Sister's Island.

Mom and Uncle Norm and Claudette and Liz and even Arthur showed up for the funeral. There were a lot of people from town who parked their cars all along the mainland road, facing the Island, who just stood outside next to their cars and on the road, paying respects. The older men and some of the younger ones and some of the women held their hats in their hands. I counted over a hundred-and-forty people. I didn't know how many people knew Bee, from town. She always never talked about town, except when she asked Uncle Norm to pick something up for her.

The funeral was small and it was a sad day, but Bee had thought of that already, and she hadn't wanted it to be too sad, because her lawyer had brought a treasure map to give us right after the funeral was done, and Bee was in the ground. None of us even knew Bee had a lawyer, until the lawyer showed up and showed us a letter which was from Bee, in her handwriting. She signed it "BB", which was meant for me. That won't mean anything to you right now, but it meant enough to me then. The lawyer was legit. Bee knew I would be wondering that. Bee knew me.

I had go take a break from painting for a while, to tell this story properly. It's hard work, trying to decide what to say first about yourself. I used to think about other people a lot, but I didn't think about myself as much. I used to have this dream now and then, where I was a floating eyeball, and I would float around and watch other people having their dreams. I was in their dream, but I was a an eyeball, and they were the main character in the dream, so I sort of didn't think of me as me, in the dream. It wasn't until I would wake up that I'd think, hey, I think I was the eyeball watching the person who was dreaming, and not the person dreaming. That was somebody else.

I haven't had that dream in a little while - though last year I had a dream where I was the person dreaming, and I noticed there was an eyeball floating around watching me have the dream, but I wasn't the eyeball anymore. I think that means something, but who knows when it comes to dreams. I certainly don't. But I think it meant something.

It's hard to know where to start, when I'm trying to tell my story. I didn't think it would be hard, when I said sure, ok, I'll do that, after the voice told me I should. At the time, I think I imagined starting from the time before I was born, and then moving on to when I was born, and then when I was a baby, and etcetera until the story would end with me sitting in Bee's kitchen, which is now my kitchen, painting the walls yellow instead of black, and telling you my story. The end. For now.

But that's not what seems to be happening. I'm jumping all over the place. The timeline is all whack. A promise is a promise, I'll keep going. Eventually all the moments will be strung together, if I just keep going. What else could happen? There are only so many moments to cover. It's just a matter of time. I have to watch this paint dry anyway. I might as well tell my story while I'm watching paint dry.

I'm going to skip over the gnomes, though, for now. That part's one of the weirder parts, and I think I should save it for a cliffhanger or when I run out of normal things to write about.

Sisters Island is in Elders Bay, which is near Elders Falls, and also near Elders Mountain. That's all that's named after the Elders, around here. Buddy Elders was the last of the Elders. He died about ten years ago now. He was pretty old when I first met him, and he died not long after that, after leaving me a ball field. He left Liz a church, and Niall a mineshaft.

That was a definite plot twist, partway through my story. I'm probably giving away all the best spoilers. I also forgot the high school was also named after the Elders, and one of the clothing stores in town. It was called Elders Used Clothing Store, in case that's important.

Buddy Elders left all the kids at Elders High some part of the County actually, which we found out he had inherited. Every kid who graduated got something - a field, a house, a water tower, a beach, a gazebo, a wood lot, a warehouse... the list went on. Any kid who hadn't graduated was given an I.O.U. for something, redeemable at their graduation. There was a lawyer running around doing all the verifying and handing out of prizes. That year, everybody graduated, even the ones who had already decided earlier that wasn't going to be part of their story. Buddy was a weird, clever old guy.

I didn't think counties were things people could inherit, but I guess Elders County was. By the time Buddy was done getting fully, legally dead, most of the town was owned by people who had just graduated from high school, and a lot of them started businesses, or sold their inheritance to go travelling or learn a valuable life lesson by blowing it on something dumb. A few joined city council, after they learned what they could and couldn't do with their land or whatever, and three of those eventually ran for mayor, and one of them won and is a good mayor, if you ask me. Their name is Laurel. I think they spell it with an extra a, but I don't know.

I had forgotten that the Elders called the county Elders County too. I've probably forgotten other things named Elders. You get the idea, let's move on.

Sisters Island is in Elders Bay. It's not far from the Mainland Road, which is pinched between the Bay and Elders Mountain. The town is not far away either - you can leave the Island by boat at high tide, row across to the dock off the Mainland Road, moor the thing so it doesn't float away, then ride a bike into town, all in about an hour. If you hitchhike, you can get there in about half that time, but I don't recommend hitchhiking unless you know whose car you're getting into, and you trust them. Why do I need to say this, I don't know - I just think it's important to say. Maybe that's the reason I'm telling my story, for the safety tips. You never know.

Also, you really have to watch the road, when you're mooring your boat. And wear something reflective when you're on the side of the road at dusk, or dawn, or at night. Just be safe, and think about safety more often. I wish I knew that when I was younger. That's why I'm telling you, in case you're younger, and on the side of the road, like I was.

Elders Falls is a really nice town. It's got a grocery store and a Thom Thorntons, and a mechanics shop, and a car dealership, and two taprooms (which were called bars once), and a library and a town hall, and other buildings and businesses. I'm not going to name them all. I might draw you a map later. There's an arcade and comic shop that are attached together too, I forgot that. That's my favourite place in town, I think. It's across the street from Too-Toonies and the Garden Centre. That's my favourite street. It's called Elders Avenue. The avenue part means it connects two longer streets. Those are Main Street and Queen Street. Every town and city in the country has those. Elders Avenue is on a steep hill, because Elders Falls is on a steep hill. The hill is not named after the Elders, it's just called the Hill, around here. The Mountain is named Elders, though. Taller, I guess. More worthy of a name.

I'm not really doing a good job describing Elders Falls. I went to the library yesterday to use the Internet and looked up some facts about Elders Falls so I could describe it better. The list is interesting but maybe not important to include in my story. I actually can't decide. Elders Falls, as of this writing, has seven thousand people in it. That sounds like a lot of people, but when you wander around town you really couldn't tell there were seven thousand of us. A lot of those people live in the surrounding area. There's a fishing community across the Bay from the town, and I think some of the seven thousand people live there. Not that many, but some.

Elders Falls was founded in eighteen-sixty-four, according to the website. There were people here before that, and after that there were a lot more people, who came by train. There were controversies and the land here was stolen, although how that story goes depends what you're reading or who you're talking to about it. The Land has never been given back, but the mayor had promised to talk about that idea when they were trying to get elected, and they got elected anyway, so you never know what might happen. I hope the future from now on is always better than the past.

I saw Elders Falls the first time when I was eleven. Mom drove me and Turtle Norm and Dooley to go stay with Great Aunt Bee for that Summer, and she ended up leaving us there for a whole year. I don't think she planned to do it that way - that's just what happened. She had a good reason. I don't remember what it was, exactly. Mom always has her reasons. It's been a long time since I was mad at her for that year. I think we needed a break from each other anyway.

When we first got to the outskirts of Elders Falls, we passed a sign that said Elders Fall. The s had fallen off, and that was funny enough, but what was funnier was that the sign was saying that elders fall, which they do. That's not always funny, because falls when you're elderly can be serous business. I'm not making fun of people getting hurt. Maybe you had to be there. I needed a laugh right then, right there, and then we passed this sign, and it had at least two separate accidental jokes in it, and I definitely didn't laugh on the outside, because I was not having a good day right then. But seeing that sign made me feel better. I couldn't help it.

Nobody fixed that sign the whole year I was staying with Bee. I saw it one other time, on the way back out of Elders Falls with Claudette, and the s was still gone, and the Elders were still falling. That time, I chuckled out loud, and Claudette guessed it was because of the sign. I was sad to be leaving Elders Falls, but not sad enough not to have a laugh at their stupid sign.

You might be wondering if there is a waterfall in Elders Falls. There is one, if you're wondering that. The people in the town of Elders Falls call the waterfall outside of town Bently Morgan Falls. Bently is my grandfather's name, but the waterfall and my grandfather were both named after his grandfather, the original Bently Morgan. Bee told me she had met him before he died, and that he had really thick spectacles, and impressive sideburns.

I found this information out in the Archive in the basement of the Elders Falls library, during my second time staying with Bee: the original Bently spelled his name Bentlii, with two i's - which somebody told me might have been Dutch. I don't know about that. I was visiting the library on my fourteenth birthday, because I was hiding from everybody and they didn't know I knew how to leave the island during high tide. I almost fell out of the rowboat and I walked to town after that, and the library was open and that's how I found out about older-four-eyed-Bently-with-two-i's.

I want to tell you more about Bee, but not right now. I'm watching paint dry.

I know more people than just the ones I've mentioned already, of course. There's all the people back home, but none of them are my friends or family, and if I start telling all the stories about my neighbours and everybody I meet, we'll be here a long time. I don't know how many of those other people matter. That doesn't sound like the right way to say that. I think you know what I mean to say though. Where does a person's story stop? When do you go from being the main character, to a floating eye watching some other main character? I'm trying something different with my writing.

There was Officer Hope Flowers. He died last week. I couldn't cry about him either. I've just lost a lot of people in my life. I'm not sure my life is a happy story all the time. I'm happy some days, but I'd be happier if people and dogs didn't die so often. I'll be dead someday too. Not to be dark about it, that's what happens. The voice told me to get on with telling my story. I think it meant, while I'm still kicking. I'm telling other people's stories too, while I'm at it. I had to stop and think for a while whether that was the reason I said yes to this - some storytelling needs to happen before this storytellers buys the farm, in some farming accident. I think it might have been the reason. I wish I could remember.

Officer Hope Flowers was already pretty damn old when I met him. He's the oldest man to ever live in Elders Falls, according to the Elders Falls Radio (CFGH-FM, 101.01 *The Falls*) piece I heard yesterday morning. I listen to The Falls most every day, while I'm doing whatever I'm doing that doesn't involve listening to something else. Hope was a good person. An actual war hero too, and I miss him. I think he missed Bee, and that's why he didn't waste much time after she died.

I'm not sure why the voice asked me to tell you my story right this particular week. It was bad timing, in my opinion. I'll talk about Hope later.

There are two ways to get onto Sisters Island - the boat, and the causeway. The causeway is a bit unusual. It's underwater at high tide. This means it's really, really unsafe to get used to using the causeway to get to and from the island, and so most of the time, we don't use it. There's a gate at the mainland side, and only Bee has the key. Had it. I've got it now. Now it's my gate, I guess. That's a very weird feeling. You'd have to have been there, the whole time, to understand how weird a feeling it is that this house and that gate and the whole island is mine, but I think you can imagine.

The causeway isn't straight either. I don't really know what the person was thinking, who built it. Bee said the island has a weird history, and that I didn't know the half of it. I remember not believing her at first, but then I started exploring the island and I stopped not-believing everything she told be about things. I'm still not done stopping not-believing all the things she's told me. I probably won't be until I'm old and dead too.

The gnomes give me the willies sometimes, I have to admit. I've Gnown about them for a few years now, but I've never really gotten really used to them being there. I think I'll tell you that part soon.

When I first arrived at my Great Aunt Bee's house, I had already seen the sign that said Elders Fall, and then I saw Elders Mountain, and the train, and the train bridge and ravine, and then Bently Morgan Falls, and I saw an eagle, and we stopped at a gas station and the guy there told Mom that Sisters Island was haunted, and then we saw the town as the sun was starting to set, but we weren't going there - we hung a left and followed the Mainland Road, and the Mountain was right there - very close, and steep and it gave me vertigo to be so close to it, even though we weren't up high. On the other side of the road, the ocean was right there - and I worried we might just drive into the ocean and splash - the whole Morgan clan would sink to the bottom of the sea. I think I had a panic attack. The lights coming on in the town across the water is what kept me from having a panic attack. The lights on the water from the town were beautiful.

It wasn't long before we crossed under the train bridge and then went up a crazy zig-zag part of the road and I was really trying not to throw up. Dooley kept barking at seagulls. They were everywhere. There were boats out in the Bay. I didn't know what they were doing, and I didn't know it was called a Bay. There was a lighthouse far off, and its light came on and the town's lights kept coming on, and then the sunset happened and the sky behind turned all these shades of pink and orange and I understood why people believe in god or magic, even though light and seagulls and even boats are all just Science. Science is enough. I was- I didn't know where to look. Everything was just beautiful. I had only seen the city, my whole life.

My whole life, I had never seen any of these things. I'd seen them on TV, but I hadn't seen any of these things.

All that stuff happened to me before I ever saw Sisters Island, and then we went around another corner and there it was - right out in the Bay, closer to the Mountain than the town. I thought it would be way out, but it was close. Not close enough to get a baseball to, unless you were a major leaguer - and only a really really top-notch one, and only in some spots, and only with a bat. I don't know how many meters that is. I saw all of that, and then Sisters Island, and it was closer and bigger than I thought.

I had thought the island would be small, and we'd have to row and row out to it. Mom never mentioned there was a causeway. When I saw the causeway, it was already half underwater, because the tide was coming in. I didn't know about tides. I had read about tides and been told about tides in school, but I didn't know about them. By the time we had parked our car near the causeway gate, even less of the causeway was above water. By the time we got our stuff into the boat, the sun was down and the moon was out and we were using the moonlight to see what we were doing, and I never knew moonlight could be that bright, and I had forgotten what it felt like to be so terrified and excited that I couldn't stop spinning around in one spot, so that's what I did, until Mom told me to cut it out and help her with the groceries. She meant, help her put them into the rowboat, because we were about to row a boat across a bay to an island, in the moonlight.

I loved my Great Aunt Bee before I ever met her. I never, ever stopped.
