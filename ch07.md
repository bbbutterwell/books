# Departure

[*v. 20220414*]

To my friend, Dagnett Booknard,

Hello, Dagnett. I hope the Archive is treating you well. I dropped by the upper level to see if I could catch you before you descended into the depths for however many days or weeks you tend to take down there, but I was an hour too late, so I am writing you this note to let you know where I've disappeared to. I've been given a mission. I am not permitted to divulge where in the Realms I am being sent, but they've said nothing in particular about being tight-lipped as to the reason. In fact, the rumour I believe is being allowed to spread gradually in the halls of the Observatory and the Arbitorium both. We might be in luck; our careers might not be destined to be in vain, as we once thought.

There has been a mysterious benefactor recently come forth, offering a large sum of silver to the Executors, on the condition it be used solely in the production of a single update to the Short Account of Known Heroes. Perhaps you will have heard this news already, but I was too excited to not tell you myself. 

Although it is commonly known that the Executive Code is by definition open to modification at any time, under the right conditions, no Minister I have ever discussed this topic with has ever been able to clarify to me what those conditions might be. It seems to me that, regarding this secret, only the Executors themselves hold the key.

Apparently, a good deal of silver in some cases might be enough. I am on the one hand somewhat disillusioned to discover this, and by the same token, not terribly surprised. One can't, in any case, look a giftmule in the mouth. We have been reactivated, if only for a single issue. Perhaps, if our job is done well, others might follow. Even if not, then our issue will become the most recent, for future generations to regard as the noblest work of interpretative history the world has ever known: that of the definition of what it requires to be considered a Hero, in the eyes of Folk. I cannot imagine a better mission, than to be entrusted to revive the Realmic zeal for the uncommon Hero, which are so sorely needed these days, as you know.  

I am quite giddy to get on the road. I haven't been issued my traveling maps yet, but once I have, I will be well on my way, to find the subject in question.

Curiously, they present in common and unassuming form. I believe we may be dealing with a Druid of great craft. I was entirely underwhelmed viewing the creature, which can only mean I am in for a great surprise, when I finally meet our Chosen One. I have been asked on the way to update existing records of last-known heroes; whether they still live, if they are still suitably Heroic, and what additional deeds should need to be added to their respective registries. I have been issued two items from the Stores, to aid me in my travels abroad.

I look forward to meeting with you on my return, old friend, though I can't say when I might be back in Owl. In years past, the Account as you know was updated every second year, and so I will endeavour to complete the task well within that time frame, to increase our chances of being permanently reinstated into service. You have my oath: I will do my best.

Take care in the Archives. Get fresh air frequently, although I know the Booknard clan are quite famous for needing surprisingly little of that, you are nonetheless still flesh and blood. See the sun now and then - the books will be there when you return, I can almost assure you.

Until some other time,

Your friend,

B. Noonstar

Road Journal, 

Bardlii Noonstar,

Observator, 4th rank, HOO

I am one day out of the Capital, traveling with a contingent of soldiers tasked with traveling the Kings Road, left-wise, through the Norland Wood, to the Cape of Gareth and along the Iced Coast, and eventually back again. I will not be following them for long - I part ways with the company in the town of Somedruthers. I have never been out of the Capital. I have envisioned it in my mind, every day of my life, at least for a few moments. From the town, I will head Seaward through the Norland and bend right, until I encounter the trail know as the Hillsnake. This begins a long journey, and protocol does not permit me to document in advance where I will go from there, so as not to endanger my quarry unduly.

I have brought two items from the Stores with me, to aid me on my journeys. I can only believe that I have chosen wisely. The rest is with the Fate.

This endeavour cannot be dismissed as a frivolous expense in silver, as some seen fit to protest openly within the halls of the Trunk. They are driven by jealousy, or else a lack of vision. I am aware, like most of my colleagues in the twin Ministries of the Observatory and the Arbitorium, of the significance of the task.

There are none in the Realms, I will well wager, who do not in some measure aspire to the ranks of Heroship - though more than many consider the road too long, and the cost of walking it too great. Heroes from the dawn of history have been drawn from those select few who possess the rare mettle to aspire to it, and without the adoration of the masses, and the recognition of the State, even these are as likely to remain to wallow in obscurity, as they are to rise to their occasion. This is the nature of Folk, as we know- to be driven or coerced toward this way of action or that, by the balance of forces within and without themselves. 

Owl itself was founded upon that wisest of insights: that the deepening of our knowledge of the inner workings of the hearts and minds of Folk would lead, invariably, to the final, perfect, self-reflecting Law which will best govern societies of hearts and minds, at scale. The carrot and stick which are the mantles and sentences of Heroship and Villainy are of such fundamental function to these laws, that they bear oft-repeating, for being that obvious and uncontroversial, as to be too easily dismissed and forgotten. It is a mantra to say that a Person will act to be less a villain than a hero, if there is known to be, in essence, some silver in it, at the end of the day.

I consider this the perfect age and assignment to have been created for! I am fortunate to bear witness to the unlocking, perhaps in my own lifetime, of every remaining secret of the spirited beast. Owl is the Alchemist that will concoct a new age of peace upon this planet - its citizens are both its reagents, and also its ailing subjects.

May the Fate guide me in the choices which follow mine others to date,

B. Noonstar,

In search of the next Hero of Renown

I fell off the stupid roof. I found some masking tape and it turns out that's not as strong as duct tape, no matter how much you use, especially when the ladder's wet. I might have broken my leg but maybe not. I'm going to blame Norm, once I finish crawling to the wherever I left my phone, and then finish crawling to wherever I left my charger. I wish I had thought to use my phone to record my story, instead of an old tape recorder.
