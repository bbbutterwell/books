## Maevis Morgan

*yy0409*

My name is Maeve Morgan, and I'm here to tell you a story. I mean, I'm probably *here* for other things, but I'm here to tell you a story too. You might be wondering what the story is. I'm sort of wondering that too. I mean, I just learned pretty recently that I had to tell it. I was told that if I didn't, well, who would? The voice had a fair point, I suppose.

I'm twenty-seven right now, but by the time you read it, I'll probably be older. I think that's probably more than probably. I don't believe in time travel, so unless I'm wrong about that, I'm older now, when you're reading this. Not younger, and not the same age. You might believe me or not believe me. About time travel not being possible. That's ok, I understand.

I'm about a third of the way through my life, if my math is right. Maybe a fourth. Taking into account advances in medicine of course, I might be wrong about that too. I think I'm going to live a long time. I have a hunch. I think it's because I was created, and then told I had a destiny. The destiny involved getting a chance to be pretty old. I'm going to be pretty old someday. Maybe that day's already arrived, when you're reading this. I hope I'm aging gracefully. I don't say maths because I'm not from England or some other places where they say maths. 

I can't say for certain how much I've changed, since I was a kid. I still feel like me. I know I've gotten taller, I know I've had more life experiences, and I know that I believe different things than I once did. But at the same time, I really feel like the same person too.

This might be how other people feel, I don't know. I haven't asked too many other people, but I have asked a few other people. I think they feel the same way as I do: they are sort of the same, and sort of different. They're each having a different life story than I am, though. The details are pretty different, but the conclusions... well, some of them are the same.

Right now, I've been told that if I tell my story and can make it sound really interesting, it might make the lives of other people (who aren't me) somehow better. I'm not sure I understand that, or really, why I would go to all the trouble to tell a long story, just so somebody else can have a better life. Hey, I'm not that selfish, but I'm busy like most people. I have my own problems. Right now, for example, I'm under-employed. Ok, I'm unemployed. They're kind of the same thing.

I wouldn't mind if *my* life got better, if I went to the trouble of making the story about it interesting to read. Doesn't that seem a bit more fair? I think it does. What do you think? That's what they call a rhetorical question, of course. You can't answer me so I can hear you - at least, I can't hear the answer while I'm recording this. I might hear it afterward, I don't really know.

Anyway, I suppose you'd like me to explain what the voice is that I'm talking about, or maybe where I grew up, or why I'm unemployed at the moment, or any of those sorts of things. keep calm - I'll do my best. I'll start at almost the beginning.

---

I was born on a Wednesday, and my mother's name was Ani Esther Morgan. I was an only child, and still am. My mother's name is also still Ani Esther Morgan. Some things don't change.

I apparently cried a lot at first, then sort of gave up on the whole crying thing, for the most part. That's how Mom describes it: "One day you wouldn't shut up with the crying, then the next day, you decided you had enough of that, and I haven't really heard you cry since then". That's more-or-less what she told me once or twice, and I suppose I believe her. I don't really remember crying about anything. I'm not always happy, but I keep the waterworks in check around other people, including me. Other people have enough problems, like I do. 

Ani didn't have a husband or a boyfriend when I was born. The man who got her pregnant with me was named either Denny or Floyd. That's one thing I know about my parents: Their names are Ani and either Denny or Floyd.

I don't really think about Denny or Floyd at all, really. They're not in my life, and they chose it that way, and I guess I had to be ok with that, and so I am. I wish them well but don't miss them, since they don't seem to miss me. Does that make me sad? I mean, isn't that a sad way to be, not caring about half the people who made you (or two-thirds, sort of, in my case)? I don't know, that's just my backstory, regarding parents. I've met some good examples of parents in my life - my Mom Ani, for instance, is a pretty good example - so I know a thing or two about how that can be a lucky thing, for a kid to have. I mean, two pretty decent parents are what you're hoping for. But a lot of us only have one, and some don't have any. And then some had one or two who were the opposite of decent. I got off pretty lucky. Denny or Floyd might not have wanted a daughter enough to stick around, but they never went out of their way to be mean about it, either.

Anyway, enough about Denny or Floyd. Like I said, I don't really think about them. I'm just giving you my backstory. I wish I could give them different names, but those are there names they came with, and I didn't really have any say in that.

I had a dog once too. He was like my brother, you could say. He was there when Ani brought me home. He was there when I left home, to live on my own for the first time. You can imagine how much I loved that dog. You're doing the math, or maths, I don't know where you live, by now, and figuring out that he's probably dead, by the time I'm writing this. Long dead really. Dogs don't live as long as they should. It's kind of sad, how that goes. Turtles live a long time, so do parrots. I've never met a parrot, but I had a turtle once. Her name was Norm. She went to live with my Uncle, a few years ago. My uncle's name is Norm too. There's a connection there - it's not a coincidence. Both Norms (since I last checked, which was yesterday) are still alive and kicking. But again, I've never met a parrot.

My point went sideways there. My point is: dogs should live at least as long as turtles, parrots, and people. It really doesn't make any sense that the best ones barely make it to fifteen, sometimes. Fifteen. What the hell, Nature. I don't get how that's fair. Anyhow, that dog's name was Dooley. I sometimes called him Drools. There was a reason there, not a coincidence either. You might be able to guess what the reason was.

I think I'll skip ahead and not tell you about all my growing-up stuff. It's kind of straightforward, nothing too exciting. Mother Ani and I travelled around a lot, with Dooley and Norm (Turtle Norm, not Uncle Norm), having adventures without Denny or Floyd, and we never really lived in one place very long, because Mom was still looking for her calling. I get it. I'm doing that now too. At the time though (sometimes, anyway), I didn't understand at all why we had to keep moving, and I got shouty sometimes and sometimes I just acted out and sometimes I tried to run away and things weren't totally smooth between us, but we survived and things are ok now.

I don't want to give you any spoilers, but yes we're ok now. I mean, Dooley's not ok in the same sort of way, since dogs only live for a short time and I'm twenty-seven when I'm writing this. You can do the math / maths. I still miss him.

Here's what I can tell you about the voice. I heard it the first time before I was born, and I've heard it about four times in all. It's pretty specific, kind of gravelly but not unfriendly or mean or anything. Just kind of haggard, like whoever's voice it is has been doing voices for a long, long time, and is way over the novelty, and maybe has a bunch of people to talk to and so doesn't pop by very often, but when they do, you kind of feel like you're the most important person in the room to them, but they aren't going to let you know that, just by the sound of their voice. I'm not sure I really explained any of that very well at all.

Anyhow, the voice showed up before I was born, and told me I was about to be maybe-born, and then asked me if I was ok with that. I wasn't really sure whether I was ok with it, to be honest. I had just gotten there. I didn't know where *there* was, or what being born meant, or who I was, or even how to know if I was actually *ready-or-not-here's-Maevis-Morgan-ready*... but somehow I still understood the question. Somehow. Do you know what I mean? I'm not sure you know what I mean, but then I think you might imagine what I mean.

What I mean is, I was hanging out somewhere even before I existed, and I had a choice, and that choice was real, and it was mine. The choice was: was I going to be, or was I not going to be? When I first heard that line in Hamlet, I really thought my mind would explode. That was exactly the question I had been asked, almost - the one that I answered by saying, ok, sure, I'll be.

I tried to find anything online about Shakespeare writing about his life and having been asked if he had been ok with being born, or if anybody had asked him if he had wanted to be born... but I guess they didn't really do interviews back in his day, because all I found were stories he made up, and nothing about his life or what he thought about it.

You might now be wondering, wait... is this a science fiction story? Because I just told you something that's not really normal: that I remember before I was born. I know some people believe in past lives, but I'm telling you I had a time before that, or maybe in-between those, I don't know, where I was outside of all of it, and I had a choice.

Anyhow, I think you get it. I'm not saying you should be mind-blown.. I mean, it's not that big of a deal. It's just that it's true, and I think you probably should know that about me, because I think that's probably related to how I ended up being the way I am. I walk around like everybody else in the world walks around... but unlike a lot of people, I always remember at the back of my mind that I came here because I wanted to. I mean, not just because I was curious, or it happened by accident. I chose it. I had a reason. It was a pretty specific one too. I remember thinking about being or not being, and then, I thought of the reason, and I was like, ohhh, well, then - of course, now I have to be born. Yes, please. Let's do this. I'm ready.

I've just forgotten what the reason was. That's been a problem my whole life. I should have written it down, but then who ever gets born with a notepad in their hand anyway? How would that have worked? Nobody gets born that way. You're supposed to remember, I guess. I remember that there was a reason, and it was a pretty solid one. What it was though, I couldn't tell you. Forgot. Oh well.

For a while, when I was younger, I think I just assumed everybody remembered a voice from before they were born, that they were asked to choose, and they chose yes. I figure some must have chosen no too, but then I would never have met any of those people, so it's not like they don't count, but they kind of don't count. The rest of us chose yes. That's what I think.

I also thought that most people remembered why they chose to be born, and so sometimes I would ask people to tell me why they were born, and they would either act confused or think I was kidding or being mean to them, or maybe think I meant, where do babies come from?

Whenever I would ask this question, and somebody would misunderstand or get confused or angry, I would get confused, and think I was the one misunderstanding them. It took me literally years before I figured out that most people don't actually remember the time before they were born - like, at all. They just remember from some time when they were two or three or something, or maybe even after that. Not many remember being a baby, and nobody (nobody I've met yet, anyway, that I know of) remembers being in a kind of waiting room with no furniture or walls or time, where they got to choose to be born or... whatever the alternative is to that.

Anyway. I've gone on a lot about that. But the voice made sure to tell me to mention it, when it told me I should tell my story now, so there you go. I said before that I've heard it about four times, so I'll save the other two times for later, and just tell you about the first time, and then this last time, which happened really recently. I had almost kind of forgot what it sounded like, because it had been so long since the last time I had heard it. I never once thought I had imagined it, but I did forget now and then that it had happened. But then, the other day, it happened again.

I was in the kitchen in the house on Sisters Island. I had done some painting, and I was having some tea and shortbread from Too-Toonies and looking at a college calendar, because I was thinking about going back to college, because I was under-employed at the moment.

I had been let go from my job at the electronics store in town, which is called The Gadgetorium, which is across the street from Too-Toonies, which is in Elders Falls, but I'm going too fast, I think. I had been let go from the Gadgetorium, where I had been under-employed for the past three-and-a-quarter years, selling electronics to people who weren't comfortable yet with buying electronics online. Kind of a niche market. 

This story isn't about my retail career though - I'm pretty sure I'm done with that, I think. I was reading a college calendar, trying to figure out if I could feel excited about going back to school and learning some new trade. I was considering arc welding, or maybe a career in Information Technology, where I'd specialize in cryptocurrency or Artificial Intelligence or Web Design, or maybe all three, and would try to make a fortune doing my own cryptocurrency or making websites, or both, and I'd hire only artificial intelligences, and I'd pay them well but mostly I'd treat them like they were real people, and I'd get excellent ratings on RateMyBoss or whatever because of that. But I wasn't really digging any particular thing in the calendar, really. I think you can tell that I'm not sure what I want to do, but I already know it isn't selling gadgets, and it's probably not even related to information technology. I like using information technology sometimes, and I have nothing against gadgets sometimes, but that's about as far as it goes.

I was having one of those bland sort of days, where everything is kind of like eating white bread, and you sort of feel full and a bit lazy and like you want to lie down for a while. Then I heard the voice. The first thing I thought was, oh, I forgot, I hear a voice now and then. How long has it been?

And the voice was chatty this time, and it said Maeve, it's been a while, I haven't forgotten you, I've just been busy. I said, no worries - I'm just here trying to decide what courses to take. I wasn't really talking out loud, but this is how it goes with the voice - it's like a conversation but there's never anybody around who can back you up to say that yes, you were talking to something for real.

The voice said, do you remember why you're here? And I said, well actually I'm glad you asked that, because actually I forgot why. I should have written it down. The voice said, don't worry about that, just keep at it. But in the meantime, I need you to do something. It's pretty important. I said what's that, and the voice said, you have to tell your story now. And I said to who, it it said *whom*, and I said what, and it said don't worry about it. Just tell your story. It doesn't matter how many people hear it, as long as the right one does. You should write this down. Write what down, I asked, did it mean the favour, and it said no, your story. I should write down my story, is what it said.

I thought about that and then I realized all at once that there was a really good reason, and I understood it all at once, and so I said, ohh, ok sure, yes that does make sense since you put it that way, and so the voice said ok thanks, I know you can do it, just do it. Have fun, Ok I'll talk to you later.

And then the voice was gone. I was still holding the college calendar, and if I had remembered to have a pen or pencil ready, I would have even written the reason down. The reason being, why I need to tell my story. But since I didn't have a pen or pencil, I didn't write it down, and so I forgot again. I forgot the reason that I was supposed to tell you this damn story of mine. I guess maybe the reason isn't part of the story.

I remember though that the reason made a lot of sense. I just don't know what it was any more. I am starting to think this is how the voice likes things to go down: it will hit me when I'm not expecting to have to make a decision, and then I have this decision to make, and there will be this reason for saying yes, but I will forget the reason afterward, but still remember that there was one, and that it was a good one.

Now you might be thinking, this sounds like I wasn't really given a choice, then. I mean, maybe I was tricked or something. If the reason was so good, why would anybody say no anyway? Where's the choice in that?

I get it, I do. Maybe you're wondering about free will, here. Join the club. But I don't think that's how it works. I'm still here, every day, because I made a choice to be. Right? I make that choice every day - I just forget why a lot. That doesn't make it less of a choice. I can't explain it very well, but I think maybe you understand what I mean.

So now I'm writing my story, and there's a good reason, but don't worry too much about it. Maybe the story was the reason I decided to be born, instead of not deciding to be born... and if that's true, then maybe someday I'll figure out the reason that I'm telling my story, after I've kept deciding to tell it, like it's habit, and I'm not even thinking about how much of a habit it is, to decide every day to tell my story, because it's just become something I do, because I remember that I had a really good reason to, and I stopped questioning it so much. And just did it, tell my story.

---

You should know that a lot of my story happened when I was eleven. I don't mean I didn't have other things happen to me before that and after that, but the story I feel ready to tell you now is about when I was eleven, and then decided to skip twelve and go right to having my thirteenth birthday instead. So I'm a tween in a lot of this story. 

But then I'll probably tell you about times a bit before that and then what I'm doing now, probably, because where I was before and where I am now is part of my story too, which seems obvious to say. So, pay attention, and remember I'm going to be younger or older, depending on what part of my story I'm telling you. I'll try not to be confusing.

So a lot of this story, I'll warn you, involves magic. Or something. I don't believe in god, exactly, I believe in science. Science is newer than god, and that might not make it better, or even more true, but it makes it easier to believe in, in a way. That's how I see it. I don't believe in magic either, I believe in science. I think I said that already, right?

Here's the thing. I think god and magic might just be science. Think about it this way. Let's think about lightning. People used to think lightning was god, or it was magic. Now we know it's electricity. I don't really understand exactly how electricity works, but I did once, when I was in school, for about a week, around exams. I've kind of forgotten the specifics. There's positive and negative particles, and they're attracted to each other, and static cling is a small example, and turning on a light bulb is a medium example, and getting hit by lightning is a really extreme example. Same stuff: electricity.

It doesn't matter - my point is, electricity is science now, not god, and not magic. So, what you might call god or magic or whatever, is probably just science, right? Maybe not yet - but someday. That's what I believe, anyway, at the moment. So, I think that's called being agnostic.

The voice is science too. I'm pretty sure that's true. I can't explain it, but people from the future will probably be able to. They might hear this story and say, Oh, that Maevis Morgan, she's describing such-and-such-ology, but she's calling it a 'voice', and the people of her time period think she was talking about god or magic, but it was just science, all along. Aren't we smarter now, than they were back then? Yes, yes we are. And then they'll pat their own backs, for being so clever.

So, this is sort of a science book, but it's my story too, so it's, what, a science autobiography. I mean, it's an autobiography, but I'm going to talk about magic and voices, and someday that will all just be plain old science. I don't know whatever-ology it is yet, that's all. You get what I mean, I think.
