## Prologue

*updated 2022-05-07*

*First, a short note, regarding the usage of all footnotes to follow: 
Every four chapters, beginning with this one, will doubtless indulge in the questionable use of footnotes, and sometimes overly so - though the remaining chapters will remain assuredly bereft of these things, instead indulging in different means of extended exposition - such as the infamously avoidable run-on sentence. Whether the Reader is a lover or a hater of footnotery, or other sorts of elongated prosery, they are therefore advised that there will be something to both love and to hate, in several parts of this story of heroics and Fate.*

Harlo the Harbinger was one hells of a hooded hero. There were of course other hooded rats who had a thing or two about them that stood them out. That's how the Worlds go: not every rat or such is created equal - some have hoods, for example - but every one is created to be something, for certain. 

Harlo was created to be a *True Hero*, as it happens. And as most True Heroes so often have, he had no idea at all that this was true about himself, until he had to become one.

For this to have happened - for Harlo to have become the true, harbinging, hooded hero that he came to be, he had to first *believe* this was possible at all - even for one, single moment. Belief doesn't need much of a window, you know, to get its foot squarely in your doorjamb. Then it's all over for you, and also begun: you've started to see the Hero that you might someday become. 

Maybe. There's always that *maybe*; the choice still has to be one's very own. 

What kind of heroic harbinger was Harlo, anyhow? At first, not much of one at all. He was given that title by walking into a town on the Very Verge of Despair, and just on the right afternoon. [^vergeOfDespair]

As though the folk of Foggy Hollows (the town on the Verge, of which I speak), needed more news of any kind at all. It was a town known already for its news - was founded upon news, in fact. When the Great Change began creeping from the North and West, across the nameless plains of ill omens, and toward the Verge of Despair - beyond which by a mere stone's throw, the town of Foggy Hollows sat squatly perpetually awaiting the Final, Great Boot to drop (the boot is mostly metaphorical here) - the townsfolk wearily reacted with a practiced and collective sigh. *Wonderful*, they all thought - *even more news*.

Shops closed (possibly for good, again), people hammered extra boards upon their windows (the town's wise, old Window Boarder did brisk business in Foggy Hollows, in spite of occasional slow seasons of relative calm), and visitors were ominously told, yet again, they had *best leave, before it was too late*. That's the kind of place Foggy Hollows is. The name too, really, should have been a clear clue. 

But to those folk, at least, news came in only one sort: the bad sort. Harbingers, therefore, were considered in that same light: who would want one, anyway? None had thought for a moment that news might be anything other than unwelcome.

But I am getting far too ahead of things. I was about to give away just then just how Harlo became a True Hero and also a good harbinger, as well as believer in himself - all in some sort of order - but I am not the proper narrator of this story, and it is not at all up to me to decide when we get there, or how, or even if. 

That is for Maevis Morgan to get around to telling you, in the manner she goes about telling a story - which is entirely her own.

You'll meet Maeve in a short moment. Now I must depart - I have been asked to witness the starting of completely other story elsewhere, and I am already nearly nine-hundreds words late. 

I pray you enjoy following the tales of Maevis Beatrice Morgan, and how her life has anything at all to do with a hooded rat, hopeful harbinging, and truest heroes of great renown.

[^vergeOfDespair]: The Very Verge of Despair is a place in the Allegoriian Isles. It is a region bordering the vast, nameless plains of ill omens.[^namelessPlains] It separates this plain from the Realms of Folk.[^realmsOfFolk] It is located somewhere on the Isle of Nought.[^isleOfNought] This is where the Great Change had chosen to make its presence known, in the year approaching that of which we speak.[^greatChange]

[^allegorrianIsles]: Which is where our story starts, departs, and returns to, now and then.

[^namelessPlains]: It is customary in some places of the Isles to not give places of ill omens names - especially capitalized ones. You have to understand the level of superstition one encounters in a world where there very clearly *is* magic nearly everywhere. Nothing makes a lot of sense, but sometimes it makes just enough.

[^realmsOfFolk]: Which is where the Folk live. People, and any species People eventually deem to be sufficiently People-like, and worthy of being deemed so, and so on. 

[^isleOfNought]: Where the Nought is rumoured to have begun to be insatiably spun. More on this phenomenon at some much later time - we are destined to need to deal with it at some point.

[^greatChange]: The Great Change is an event of Worlds-altering relevance, which began as a rather sudden encroachment of the Seas, on the border regions of the Realms of Folk, which brought with it no small amount of trouble - including, as you might surmise of a world filled with dungeons and subterranean labyrinths and entire kingdoms of caverns, no small number of refugees of previously unsettling disposition. The Great Change was not at the time considered anything Great, by nearly anyone at all.[^chaosWarlocks]

[^chaosWarlocks]: Except, of course, for the Chaos Warlocks. They always love when things go thoroughly sideways, it seems.
