## Prologue

*updated 2022-05-07*

*[Editor's note: the following prologue makes excessive use of nested footnotes. This is unavoidable, given the Author has only recently learned about how to make footnotes at all, and cannot be properly reasoned with while learning new things. We promise to keep the footnoting at a reasonable volume, once the prologue is concluded.[^untruth] Your patience and support is appreciated.]*

Harlo the Harbinger was one heck of a Hooded Hero. There were of course other hooded rats who had a thing or two about them that stood out - that's how the World goes. Not all two rats are created equal - some have hoods, for instance - but they're all created to be something. Harlo was created to be a Hero, as it happens. Like most real Heroes, he had no idea this was true about himself, naturally, until he was one (suddenly)... and then only sometime later on, upon reflection, he knew it to be true.

For this to have happened - for Harlo to have become the Harbinging, Hooded Hero that he came to be, he had to first believe it was possible at all. Even for one moment. Belief doesn't need much of a window to get its foot in your doorjamb - then it's all over: you've begun to see the Hero that you were created to be, maybe. There's always that maybe though - the choice has to be yours. 

What kind of Harbinger was Harlo? At first, not one at all. He was given that title by walking into a town on the Verge of Despair, just when the town needed a good Harbinger. [^vergeOfDespair]

As though the folk of Foggy Hollows (the town on the Verge, of which I speak), needed more bad news. It was a town known already for its bad news - was founded upon bad news, in fact. When the Great Change began creeping from the North and West, across the nameless plain of ill omen, and toward the Verge of Despair - beyond which by a mere stone's throw, the town of Foggy Hollows sat, perpetually waiting for the Final, Great Boot to drop (the boot is mostly metaphorical here) - the townsfolk wearily reacted with a practiced and collective sigh. 

Shops closed (possibly for good, again), people hammered extra boards on their windows (the town's wise old Window Boarder did brisk business in Foggy Hollows, despite the occasional slow seasons of relative calm), and visitors were ominously told they had *best leave, before it was too late*. That's the kind of place Foggy Hollows is. The name too, really, should have been a clue.

But I am getting far too ahead of things. I was about to give away to you just how Harlo became a Hero and also a Harbinger, and a believer in himself - in some sort of order - but I am not the real narrator of this story, and it is not up to me to decide when we get there, or how, or even if. That is for Maeve Morgan to get around to telling you, in the manner she goes about telling a story - which is her own.

You'll meet her in a short moment. Now I have to run - I have been asked to witness the starting of another story elsewhere, and I am already nearly nine-hundreds words late. 

I hope you enjoy meeting Maevis.

[^untruth]: This turns out to be a lie, later on. Maeve's chapters at least, the Reader may be delighted to learn, make no use of footnotes whatsoever, and in fact are somewhat lacking in helpful syntax of any sort.

[^vergeOfDespair]: The Verge of Despair is a place in the Allegoriian Isles. It is a region bordering a vast, nameless plain of ill omens.[^namelessPlains] It separates this plain from the Realms of Folk.[^realmsOfFolk] It is located somewhere on the Isle of Nought.[^isleOfNought] This is where the Great Change had chosen to make its presence known, in the year approaching that of Nought.[^greatChange]

[^allegorrianIsles]: Which is where our story starts, departs, and returns to, now and then.

[^namelessPlains]: It is customary in some places of the Isles to not give places of ill omens names - especially capitalized ones. You have to understand the level of superstition one encounters in a world where there very clearly *is* magic nearly everywhere. Nothing makes a lot of sense, but sometimes it makes just enough.

[^realmsOfFolk]: Which is where the Folk live. People, and any species People eventually deem to be People-like, and worthy of being deemed so, and so on. 

[^isleOfNought]: Where the Nought is rumoured to have begun to be spun. More on this phenomenon at some much later time. We are destined to need to deal with it at some point.

[^greatChange]: This is an event of Worlds-changing relevance, which began as a rather sudden encroachment of the Seas, on the border regions of the Realms of Folk, which brought with it no small amount of trouble - including, as you might surmise of a world filled with dungeons and subterranean labyrinths and entire kingdoms of caverns, no small number of refugees of previously unsettling disposition. The Great Change was not at the time considered anything Great, by nearly anyone at all.[^chaosWarlocks]

[^chaosWarlocks]: Except for the Chaos Warlocks, of course. They always love it when things go sideways.
