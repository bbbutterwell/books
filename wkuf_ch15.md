## When to Expect the Rain

*updated 2022-06-28*

Once upon a time, at the tail end of a too-short Winter, there was an old woman sitting on a bank by the ocean - the one which had surrounded her and her home for much of her life, and which she had come to both fear and love in equal measure, as was befitting an old woman regarding the unfathomable oceans, which always were and always would be far greater than her. 

The chill, gentle wind was the tail of this, her last cold season, and it tried in vain to bite at her through her many well-loved layers, but only her rosy cheeks felt it one bit - though more like a kiss, and not cold at all. She loved herself some scarves, and could never wrap up in enough of them these days - they whipped lazily about her face, as she squinted out at the grey and slowly heaving waters of the Bay. She was capped with three hats, overlaid, and then a bundled coat, and boots large enough for all those extra fuzzy socks - all the ones which she could manage to find, and fit on  - and then all those other layers of leggings and ankle-length skirts and worn sweaters and long underwear and other things, above and beneath one another. Not to mention the mittens upon mittens... one might easily imagine all of that, with a warm, old woman inside, I'll wager, on one wonderful Winter morning.

Just being toasty amid the late February chill was all that she really needed now - there was nothing left for her to ask for. She had had herself a commendably good time through the years, though hard ones here and there, and now her reward and rest were close at hand. There was only some handing-off to do, and then it could be truly done, for a good, long time.

The old woman turned awkwardly inside her Winter padded stuffery, as she became aware of another heavily bundled form sitting right there, close beside her. How had the woman not heard this other's approach? How long had she had company, as she had been sitting and gazing out into the Bay, and beyond?

The old woman's companion had every other bit of cold-weather clothing which the old woman had either not been able to fit over or under her own, or otherwise not known she still had at all, back at the house. Her companion was also looking out to the Bay, as the old woman had been, in much the same contented pose. 

Really though, how long had they been there, all that time?

"Maevis, what on Heaven's Earth are you wearing?" asked the old woman, "Are those all my extra scarves? Where did you find those old hats? I thought I had given them all away. That coat is too tattered. Good heavens, you'll catch a death. There's great holes in it. I had it in the sewing room so that I could cut it into ribbons, for projects."

The bundle sitting next to the old woman sat silent for a short moment still gazing out to sea, and then, raising a mitten to their lips, said "*Shhh...* I'm pretending to be an old lady with you."

The old woman paused, no longer certain what could surprise her anymore, about her niece. "I see." she said, "Well, alright then."

And so the two bundles of clothes sat together for a while, pretending to be old ladies and saying nothing at all, regarding the changing tides, at the tail end of a too-short Winter.

After some time, Maevis spoke again, "We're two pretty damn fine old ladies, aren't we, Beatrice?" The depth of the young woman's love and sadness became altogether clear, then, to Bee. She had suspected it had been there - though, as ever before, expertly unspoken.

The pang in Bee's chest came quick, but it wasn't the one that would take her. It was her sorrow for having to go, and her wonder for having had this girl in her life. Maevis had taken her breath away, and she couldn't speak for a moment, and finally she answered, "Yes. Yes we are,  Maevis, my Dearest. We are certainly that." 

And then, because of their admission and so many other things, this is what they both surely, fully became - *damn* fine old ladies. Each in their own good time.

Olive asked me, are you crying? I didn't think you did that. Mom said you never do that.

I hadn't noticed my eyes had teared up. I still hadn't gotten used to that happening yet, so my guard was down. I think Liz had broke something inside me, when she had come over and accidentally showed me how to sob properly. Got my tear ducts working again. I'm not sure I'd call it broke, I guess, but it was certainly something that got loose. Bad timing. Now I was crying in front of Olive and I hadn't even known it. This wasn't good. A person can't just lose control like that.

I wasn't about to make Olive worried, so I lied and said I was just having allergies and wiped my face, and threw in a sniffle. We have to get back to the house, I told her, the pizza's going to be ready soon, your parents are probably getting hungry. I've got allergies, don't worry about it. 

"Why would I be worried about it?" Olive's not dumb, and I don't think she believed me. I'm not so great at telling lies, especially to kids. She didn't say anything more right away though. 

Olive and I had been sitting on the New Old Shed's tiny porch, which is big enough for just two people to sit, and the fox had been dancing around down there in the elder apple trees for a good twenty minutes or so, and I suppose I had been imagining Olive and I someday being old ladies together, because why not? That's not a crime, to imagine that. It would probably happen someday, right? So what's the harm in imaging. If she didn't move away to some other place anyhow - or if she did, at least she could come back when we're both older, so we could be old ladies together for a while. At least for a while. I was just imaging, that's all.

But then I had started to think about Bee, and her last couple of weeks and I hadn't wanted to think about that right now, but that's what happened. I should have known. I was still happy about Olive seeing her first fox. The sad thoughts just all snuck up on me when my guard was down.

Crying is kind of confusing, really. You can do it when you're sad, which is what everybody knows and most people can manage, and you can do it when you're happy, which I've heard a lot about and seen a few times, but don't really get. What I'm learning though is that when you're sad and happy at the same time - which is a bit messed up, but it does happen - then that's when you're most likely to start crying. I mean, that's my experience anyway, I don't know about you. Wonderful. Something new to look out for. I didn't want to worry Olive. She's sad too. It's not my turn right now. 

The fox wasn't there anymore - it had hopped away somewhere out of sight. I don't think it had caught anything, just played with the wind for a while. Most of the time that's all it does when I'm watching. I decided from the look of the sky and the land that it was probably going to rain tonight. Let's go get some pizza, I said, and got myself up. Olive said, I'm not dumb you know, I know there's something wrong, and I said yeah I know. I'm hungry, let's go. And then we left our stuff and I put the bug net over the door and we headed back through the trees to the house. I was hoping Norm hadn't forgotten the extra cheese, and he hadn't at all - there was loads of it.

"I'm going into town to pick up some groceries" Ani announces, as she comes down the stairs and pivots down the long, narrow back hallway toward the sunroom, looking for her cigarettes. 

Maeve's been trying out the different sofas in Bee's living room, trying to determine which one she likes best, and which one she likes least, and why. Maeve has given Great Aunt Bee, who has been cleaning pots in the kitchen, a running commentary on her changing opinions of each sofa. 

During the first few minutes of this sofa-rating exercise, Bee has politely responded *Aha*, or *Really*, or *Do tell*, or just *Hm!* Each time Maeve says from the living room what new thing she thinks about one of the sofas. By Maeve's third round of all the sofas, Bee begins to experiment with responding to every other report, rather than to every one.

"This one with the flowers, I still like it in the middle, but the sides are lumpier than the one with the cat scratches on the side. I mean the red one with cat scratches, not the blue one with cat scratches."

"Well, that's interesting."

A pause as the girl jumps to another sofa.

"The one near the piano that you say doesn't work anymore makes me a little sick when I look at it. The colour reminds me of getting sick."

No response. A pause as Maeve tries on the next sofa, for the fourth time.

"I really like short couches. This is the shortest one I've ever sat on, ever."

"Yes, I think you mentioned that. Interesting. It *is* very short."

"I can still lie down straight on it without scrunching up."

Bee wants to ask if the girl has taken her shoes off from outdoors yet, but she is trying to only answer every second report now. A little *Mhm* that only Bee can hear escapes. 

"It's really comfortable though. I could fall asleep on it."

"Why don't you put your outdoor shoes out by the porch to dry them off? I noticed you found some puddles out there." Bee comes out of the kitchen and opens the door to the porch, as though demonstrating where the porch is, and how to open doors. She glances over at Maeve, who has on her shoes, lying on the shortest sofa, one foot dangling off, the other definitely not. Bee goes back into the kitchen, pretending not to see that.

"No. That's OK, they're dry now", Maeve answers.

Bee looks for another pot to scrub.

"The couch that looks like a picnic table cloth is still my favourite."

"That's nice, that it's still your favourite."

Bee can hear the child's shoed feet clumping across the hardwood, then the rug, then the hardwood again, as though the child has just gained forty pounds.

"Why is this couch look like half of it was in a fire?"

This is supposed to be the comment Bee doesn't respond to, but now Maeve is asking her a question. They both know it's a bit impolite to ignore a question. Bee bangs on the pot she's cleaning, maybe the girl will think she hasn't heard.

"Did it catch on fire?" Maeve shouts from the living room.

"What's that?" Bee looks around for the mother. Where has the mother gone? Did she hear Ani say she was going into town? Bee assumes that means with the girl. That's what Ani must mean...

"Maeve" Ani says, coming back from the long, narrow back hallway, having found no cigarettes, "did you hear me? I'm going into town to pick up grocerie.s"

"Ani dear", Bee has put a pot down rather suddenly. "You should take Maevis to help."

"Take me where?" Maeve asks, sitting on the couch with the loudest springs, bouncing herself up and down. "Who's going where?"

Ani hands Bee the dishtowel the old woman just dropped. "Bee, I have to go into town, I won't be long. You and Maeve will be fine."

"I don't - " Bee starts, "I'm not sure I'm up for that yet, Ani."

"Maeve won't be a problem. She doesn't run off anymore."

The bouncing springs get louder. Maeve shouts over the noise, "Where are we going? Is Aunt Bee coming with us?"

Ani ignores Bee's look and goes into the living room, "Maeve, leave Bee's sofas alone now. I'm going into town, just to pick up groceries, I'll be back really quick."

"Noooooo!"Maeve protests, and leaps to her feet. "I'm going with you!"

"Maeve-"

"NO. I'm going with you. You can't leave me here alone. This house is creepy."

"Maeve, that's not nice. Bee's going to be here, you won't be alone." 

Bee's come into the living room, with a pot and a dishcloth, "Ani..."

"NONONONO" Maeve is starting to flip. That's what Ani calls it - it's a switch she's tried hard Maeve's whole life to not mess with. She needs to get the kid on meds again.

"Maeve, don't start - we're guests here."

"Ani, why don't you wait until tomorrow?" Bee suggests, but now she's watching Maeve start to run around the living room in a tight circle, her head down, like a little bull, amidst all those curios. Bee hasn't seen this yet, Ani had hoped it wouldn't happen this week.

"Maeve!" Ani says, loudly "Don't start, we're guests here -"

Maeve is running a tight circle, trying hard to put her energy somewhere and not break anything. She needs out. She's going to break something. She doesn't want to break something.

"MAEVE!" Ani shouts, but Bee's out on the porch and has the porch door open now, and the girl has just charged past her mother and her great aunt and down the porch steps and is heading past the big old Elm and down Driveway Road - where she intends to throw rocks and wait for her mother to get in the boat with her, so they can go home, or get groceries. She doesn't know yet.

Ani starts after the girl, but Bee closes the porch door and puts a hand on her nieces shoulder - "Ani."

"Bee, I have to get Maeve - "

"She's fine. She's not going in the water. What's wrong? She's *fine*."

Ani's lost sight of her daughter on a big island in the middle of a bay. It took less than a day for Maeve to flip. She just needs a break.

"I need a break from my daughter, Bee. I need cigarettes, and you don't have any paper towels. We're going to need paper towels. And bandaids." 

Beatrice has not had time to adjust to being a family again. Her hip is still sore from the fall and she isn't sure she can do this again. Look after children, in lieu of their parents. "I have a bad hip."

"Well, I need to get drunk."

"No you don't. Don't you dare."

"I was joking." Ani sits down on the porch bench - the one with flattened cushions that are still a bit better than sitting on wood. She's lying about the joking part.

Bee pulls up a chair and sits across from Ani. Off in the distance, a sound like a feral child splitting a small tree in two disturbs the birds, who take flight (except for the crows, who walk briskly for cover).
