Who are Princess, Knight, and Unicorn?

The four books are Maeve's four seasons:

- **Spring** - Starts in Summer, is Bee's Autumn

- **Summer** - Starts in Autumn, is Bee's Winter

- **Autumn** - Starts in Winter, is Wimsel's Spring

- **Winter** - Starts in Spring, is Wimsel's Summer

The Pale Eye and the Burning Tear are in eternal chase, neither unified nor separated, but always in balanced motion from one to the other, preparing each other's way, and this causes all life around them.

The scene where Dooley meets Maeve when she's first brought home - he sees their whole life together, in a flash, and knows he's in.

Maeve knows that everybody in the whole world must have a reason for being. She's not sure if the reasons are all good, but she hopes they are, and she knows now that a lot of people have forgotten, whether the reason were good or bad. She wonders whether anybody would choose to be born for a bad reason. She thinks those must be villains, but she's not sure if those are real. She thinks time and fear is the real villain. She talks about Star Wars and Uncle Norm and Ani, and how they had all these star wars figures, which she found in one of the attics.

Maeve wonders if maybe the people who chose no were forced to come here anyway, and that's what a villain is. Or maybe that's where victims come from. She's asked Liz? What did Liz say?

Mention the new yellow walls when Maeve and Liz are in the kitchen.

Mention TooToonies

Talk about the Gnomes

Ch03 notes:

Maeve listens to CFGH-FM [101.01, *The Falllls!*] on her thirteenth birthday, after fixing the radio (which is a series of side quests). Does this happen after she does a bunch of target practice, and then Hope comes to pay a visit?

*Not a handy person, before fixing my first radio.* (ch03)... scene of teenage Maeve fixing something for a customer for free at the Gadgetorium, and getting in trouble with management for it. She talks about Telling her about Radio Shack. The Gadgetorium is a franchise. Maeve's become known as the person who can fix old radios? Is this timeline-appropriate?

Maeve has to bring a radio to the sleepover with Olive, and listen to CFGH-FM [101.01, *The Falllls!*]

*She started acting a bit different after that. That's around the time she started taking me out on walks.* - make it a scene.

Maeve remembers her classmates by a single thing about them.

Move the scene about dropping off Dooley to before they get to the island?

Does Turtle Norm play a bigger part in Maeve's story later?
