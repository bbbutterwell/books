Bee's problem with Dogs - Isles?

Who are Princess, Knight, and Unicorn?

IN ch 06, Maeve mentions Ani's hiking shoes. She uses these to start exploring the island when she's fifteen (Ani has small feet)

How did Ani get the magic couch back? Lynda rescued it.

How long has Maeve lived on the island? When did she come to live there full time?

The four books are Maeve's four seasons:

- **Spring** - Starts in Summer, is Bee's Autumn

- **Summer** - Starts in Autumn, is Bee's Winter

- **Autumn** - Starts in Winter, is Wimsel's Spring

- **Winter** - Starts in Spring, is Wimsel's Summer

The Pale Eye and the Burning Tear are in eternal chase, neither unified nor separated, but always in balanced motion from one to the other, preparing each other's way, and this causes all life around them.

The scene where Dooley meets Maeve when she's first brought home - he sees their whole life together, in a flash, and knows he's in.

Maeve knows that everybody in the whole world must have a reason for being. She's not sure if the reasons are all good, but she hopes they are, and she knows now that a lot of people have forgotten, whether the reason were good or bad. She wonders whether anybody would choose to be born for a bad reason. She thinks those must be villains, but she's not sure if those are real. She thinks time and fear is the real villain. She talks about Star Wars and Uncle Norm and Ani, and how they had all these star wars figures, which she found in one of the attics.

Maeve wonders if maybe the people who chose no were forced to come here anyway, and that's what a villain is. Or maybe that's where victims come from. She's asked Liz? What did Liz say?

TooToonies - Ani started it, and Norm worked there as a cashier. Norm wanted to call it TwoLoonies but Ani thought that was being insensitive to people with mental health issues, but then Norm said she was being insensitive for drawing the comparison - he meant the two of them were the Loonies. Ani just repeated her objection. They decided two dollars per item wasn't enough flexibility anyway, and besides, it was Toonies Ani had found in the couch, not Loonies. Then they argued over the spelling : TwoToonies vs TooToonies. Which one won, and why?

Chap 14: add editor note about the swearing

Chap 01: Maeve later wonders why she followed the voice's prompt to get out of the way. What was the reason for that?

Chap01: A reason being good doesn't mean it will get made. It might be a matter of caring about what is good to begin with - which lets you recognize that when you see it.

Pulled from ch10: So that's why Norm's a madman for ever driving across the causeway, even at low, low tide, and on a clear day, which are the only times he ever does, mostly. But he still does. Nobody really likes it much, that he does that. We just pretend he's being nothing but a harmless dumb-ass, and nothing bad can ever happen to dumb-asses.
