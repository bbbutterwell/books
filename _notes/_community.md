### hills-and-waters

Ah, the famous corner of Cliffs and Waters Streets - the friendliest corner in all of Elders County, according to the Elders County Community Chronicle - which is the second most-trusted printed newspaper in Elders County (of the two which remain), according to the Elders Falls Daily Dig ( which is, naturally, known to be the first most-trusted, according to itself).

Hills & Waters is where one goes to see the very best face of Folk: saying good morning, or wonderful afternoon, or pleasant evening isn't it, politely discussing the sometimes curious weather, and giving helpful directions to newcomers and the occasionally forgetful local as well.

From here, you can see the Bay, and all the boats and docks and shops, and just over there is Thom Thornton's LoFi-WiFi Donut Cafe.

Hills & Waters is where you say 'good morning', 'wonderful (or lovely) afternoon', or 'pleasant evening, isn't it?' You can nod or wave, and light questions about town are welcome too. The weather - whether it's normal or curious - is also fair game here.

### Kindly Folk @ Hills & Waters

*Nearly every afternoon, BB stands at the corner of Hills & 
Waters, holding out an old hat which they found there last year, hoping 
the rightful owner will happen along, recognize it, and put it back on 
their head, where it was meant to be.*



### Morning Folk @ Thom Thorntons

*Every second Saturday evening, BB prints 22 copies of "Silly's 
Sketchy Short Stories" at the Elders Public Library, and hands them out 
without permission at Thom Thorntons early the next morning, long 
before the manager arrives.*
