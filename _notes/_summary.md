Chapter 12

[re-read the exchange between Bardlii and Fenrii]

Start with Fenrii's journal of their journey from the fireflies to the following day, to the High Left Crossroads, where Bardlii had overheard two soliders talking, one younger calling the other older one Riteweld (Barnabas), which got the Observators' attention. Bardlii slipped the captain a note and the captain believed he had known of the instructions all along, to send Riteweld and the young solider to Somedruthers, for something or another - further instructions forthcoming. The captain though told them to bring the burro, and so that complicated things a bit.

The other solider is Aiiled, and we go into a long footnote about the 24-character Allegoriian alphabet

There is smoke over the Norlund, the cause is unknown.

As Fenrii wraps up his Journal, we get Bardlii's third-person perspective of Fenrii's thoughts and then Bardlii notes that Fenrii had forgotten the mission, but then remembered again, and then Fenrii sees BArdlii, and we drop into the Narrator's third person, past tense.

There is a conversation about observing : tenses, perspective, accuracy, influence, and responsibility. Are these tennents? [wander here - how does one observe the story without becoming it? Talk about the FORCE]. 

Aiiled tells Barnabas what he has heard of the man's exploits, and Barnabas tells Aiiled of his potential. He asks him what he might someday do, when the wars are finally done. Aiiled has never considered he'd have the chance to choose. 

Fenrii asks Bardlii about Sir Riteweld's heroics [Explore], and then, whether they were all Storied. 

"The heroes, certainly, and those caught up in their heroics - those secondary sorts"

But then are the two of them Storied now at all? If if not, what are they?

The burro has decided to let the two odd creatures who look but do not smell like men to be on their own for now - it knows some creatures are quite skittish, and doesn't want to cause a fuss.
