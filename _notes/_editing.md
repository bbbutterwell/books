Edit suggestions:

Tomorrow is now today though, and Olivia's not in her room, <mark>so maybe it wasn't</mark>.

There's a bucket for water-getting, and there was once a door, which nobody needed there anymore - it has become a workable work table around on the side... and inside, a bed frame where an air mattress might go, and a small cast-iron stove, and an old counter made new (though now only new, some time ago<mark>(?)</mark>), and a little ladder leading up to some beams and a hatch, and some shelves and a desk... and what else did a person need?

The captain wisely had us march straight through that night, and aside from one laborious and troublingly long, deep wade around a newly felled bridge, our surroundings and ourselves lit by torchlight alone in the otherwise gloom - and after which, two mules were found to be missing, once we had reached the other side - we had no more worrisome encounters in that place.

I like fluffy clouds. My favourite colour is summer-finch green. I should like to meet a real unicorn someday, as I have several questions to ask of them.
