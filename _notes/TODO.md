Maeve listening to Evil Woman on repeat

"You're staying with me all week. We're going to make a lot of pies"

Maeve has to bring a radio to the sleepover with Olive, and listen to CFGH-FM [101.01, *The Falllls!*]

Maeve remembers her classmates by a single thing about them.

Move the scene about dropping off Dooley to before they get to the island?

Does Turtle Norm play a bigger part in Maeve's story later?

Bard and Barbarian - questionably certifiable heroes

Fenrii and Bardlii talk about the Short and Long accounts.

## Ch 03

Maeve listens to CFGH-FM [101.01, *The Falllls!*] on her thirteenth birthday, after fixing the radio (which is a series of side quests). Does this happen after she does a bunch of target practice, and then Hope comes to pay a visit?

*Not a handy person, before fixing my first radio.* (ch03)... scene of teenage Maeve fixing something for a customer for free at the Gadgetorium, and getting in trouble with management for it. She talks about Telling her about Radio Shack. The Gadgetorium is a franchise. Maeve's become known as the person who can fix old radios? Is this timeline-appropriate?

How did Maeve wake up Bee (chapter 3)? How was she different before? *She started acting a bit different after that. That's around the time she started taking me out on walks.* - make it a scene.

## Ch 04

Bardlii needs to do something different on his birthday. Does he steal something trivial from the Hall?

Has Bardlii acquired outdoor boots before he left?
