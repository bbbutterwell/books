Olivia didn't say much that whole time we were getting our stuff set up for that night, just the essential things, like how to light an oil lamp, and which sleeping bag was bigger. Not much else.

I'm sort of used to that. She's always been pretty quiet. When she was really young, she would sometimes sing for no reason. Not all the time - just at particular times. She'd be quiet for long stretches - maybe days, and then out of nowhere, she'd hum this tune, or sing some words in a string, like she'd been thinking about doing it all that time, and then all the sudden, it was time to do it, and then she'd do it. It didn't matter where she was - she could be in a store, or in the car, or in her bedroom, or at school... there was no telling when she'd stop being really quiet, and suddenly start to sing, and then go back to being quiet again.

It usually didn't last too long, when she did. A few verses, maybe a whole short tune. She always made them up, they were kind of pretty. I prefer talk radio to listening to music, but I'm always glad to hear any song Olivia might sing. She never sings the same one twice. I haven't heard her sing like that for a year though. She's been sad about something, but everybody calls it angry.

After we got our stuff all sorted out, I got some lemonade into some cups and we sat out on the porch, right next to each other, because the porch isn't big enough for two people to sit too far apart, and we just sat there, and watched the sky and the water and the old, elder apple trees waving around. They'd start to shimmer once the wind picked up. That's what I call it. Olivia wasn't saying anything. I thought, someday Olivia and I will be old ladies together. Maybe you won't even be able to tell who's the oldest, we won't be that far apart, when we're that old.

After a while, Olive said,
