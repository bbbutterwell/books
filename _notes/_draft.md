Ani Esther Morgan considers how to begin this new letter, which she intends to send by electronic mail to the condo committee just before the weekend, when she and Maevis will be far away in a family campground, cooking up their last hot dogs and making up games with Monopoly money. The committee will send somebody to knock, knock, knock on their door, but nobody will be home. Ani will leave a note on the kitchen table, that reads, *Ellen, stop using your key for non-emergencies. This is still our home.*

The World Wide Web has only been open for a few short years, but Ani thinks she's already made all the electronic email mistakes a person can ever make, at least once. So she leaves out the recipient addresses until the end this time, so she won't accidentally hit the send button before the letter had all the very worst ideas edited out, all of the typos thoroughly removed, and the recipient list carefully considered and re-considered. She will do this last part very soberly.

She starts with her subject. It reads:

**Regarding our shithead neighbour, Jackson Newhouse**

It feels good to finally get that off her chest, through her fingers, to somebody else. Her computer now knows how she feels. It has no soul, of course (as far as she can tell), but since she is now connected to the World Wide Web, she believes some computer somewhere in the world - maybe the most powerful one, maybe in Russia - now also knows how she feels today, and will remember, and will understand, in its own way. 

Then she changes the subject line to: 

**Regarding our neighbour, Jackson Newhouse, the shithead**

She tries changing the "the" to an "a", to see whether that feels more or less accurate, if she were being completely honest:

**Regarding our neighbour, Jackson Newhouse, a shithead**

That doesn't seem to make it any better. Then:

**Regarding Jackson Newhouse, our Shithead Neighbour**

She wonders for a while whether either or both the words *Shithead* and *Neighbour* should be capitalized, in this case.

She shortens the Regarding to just Re: 

**Re: Jackson Newhouse, our Shithead Neighbour**

Then Ani recalls this will make people think the epithet has originated from somebody else other than her, and she certainly doesn't want to to leave that impression. She changes the Re: momentarily to "About" (with and without the colon), and plays with the case:

**About: Jackson Newhouse, our Shithead Neighbour**

**About Jackson Newhouse, our shithead Neighbour**

She rests her elbows on the desk, her chin on her interlocked hands to keep them from shaking quite so much. She stares at the screen.

Her electronic mail program has been helpfully pointing out all this time that *shithead* is not a proper word. Ani hasn't found the setting yet that will allow her to make it one.

She concludes that "Regarding" (and with a colon) is more professional, and also, first words and proper names are the only things worth capitalizing, in most cases, and so decides to stick with that, and give things a moment to settle:

**Regarding: Jackson Newhouse, our shithead neighbour**

She cracks open a beer, swings herself off her desk chair, and drops herself onto the couch sofa right next to the desk, at a right angle to it, letting the small subject line fume silently at the middle of her monitor. She has a long, several sips. She imagines possible repercussions and accusations and escalations and whether there was likely to be actual resolutions in any of it. 

This has been the first condo she has ever rented, and it would be the last, as well. She's already decided this. She still doesn't know how condo associations work, with regards to complaints, with regards to neighbours behaving poorly. She knows every association is just a bunch of people, after all, and people come in all kinds and sizes. That's all she knows about that. 

The afternoon light filtering through the eight-hundred dollar blinds evenly illuminates the small, sparse living room with the sunken floor that has barely enough room for the small, cheap computer desk, the large glass coffee table which isn't hers, and the old sofa which is the only piece of furniture she ever takes with her when she and Maevis are finally forced to move. 

It's the sofa Maevis was conceived on. Ani likes to tell visitors this, to make them uncomfortable, until she clarifies what she means. 

What she means is, she had a clear vision one day, while smoking a big joint alone one evening upon that very sofa, of having a daughter. She had never had a single notion of being a mother until that moment, but in that moment, as high as she was, it all made perfect sense. Of course she was meant to have a daughter. This vision came to Ani Morgan two years before Maevis was born, to the day. 

Finding the father to assist her with this was an altogether different story, which occurred somewhat later, and more than somewhat unfortunately.

The sofa feels like sitting on burlap, but it's even tougher and much kinder than leather, and has every possible colour in it - and somehow still looks beautiful despite these things. And all of that, to Ani, makes it a magic sofa, and not one to ever be left behind. And so Maevis and she never had left it behind. It was part of their family. 

The magic sofa always travelled with them, strapped to the top of whatever beat-up old vehicle was carrying within its belly all of their clothes, and themselves, and their other personal items, and then whatever animals had signed on to accompany the two Morgans on their here-and-back-again journeys between the Out West and the Down South. 

This old, beautiful, magic sofa had seen more states and more provinces combined than any other sofa in the world, in Ani's estimation. Maevis had taken her first fall off a sofa, from this very sofa. Its arms are scratched thin by treasured cats now passed on, or fled for parts unknown, or reluctantly relinquished. Pennies will fall from it at curious moments, when Ani and Maevis thought there could be none left inside it. Never dimes, or nickels, or quarters - and only a pair of toonies once, back when those were still sort of new. That was that time when Ani had run out of bus tickets, and would have been fired, had it not been for two toonies from Heaven, via their beautiful, magic sofa. There was no scientific explanation for it.

Ani starts rubbing the solid, thick sofa cushions on either side of her quickly, to build up some friction in her palms, which warm them up, and help her feel energized, so that she can think straight. She has to get this letter right. The right words will mean getting out of her lease a month early, which she needs to do, without forfeiting the deposit. She needs all of that to afford a used car, gas, and food to head Down South again. 

Bull had found her number, and left his usual message on the answering machine, even though the machine's leave-a-message message had the voice of an old, former neighbour, who was an army vet, telling the caller in a scary, war-hardened tone to call back later, if they had to, or leave a message if it was really urgent.

Still, the voice message left on her machine that Tuesday had known who would be listening anyway. Bull's voice never sounds urgent, just pure, dead calm.

*Babe. You can't stop a father seeing his kid. It's not right. I just want to talk. I want to see my son. I have a right to see my son. Call me back. I'm in your town now. I've got money, we can take him out for a burger. Or a salad, whatever. Your call. Call me.*

Click.

Ani rubs her palms against the old, colourful cushions, furiously.

Bull thinks Ani eats salads all the time. She almost never eats salads. She just doesn't eat meat. She's no vegan, she loves fish. To eat them, that is. Not as companions. Fish would eat her, given the chance, so she feels that's fair, as fair goes.

Bull thinks anything that doesn't have a cow or a pig in it is a salad. He also thinks their child is a boy. Ani had made sure to lie about that, so he'd at least be looking for a boy, and not Maeve, if he ever managed to find her school before Ani could manage to have the nightmare that would warn her that he was about to. 

Maevis Morgan's official name on her birth certificate is Johnny. Johnny B. Morgan.

Bull is not a man deterred by restraining orders. He has a preternatural way of getting around things like that. He is connected, in some way, Ani knows that much. She had sensed that connection about Bull when they first met - at the time, she had thought that this meant *they* had a connection, but that wasn't what she had felt at all, as it turned out. She was a bit younger then, and read things wrong a lot more than she does now. 

She had been too late to make the right decisions differently, about Maevis, and about the kind of guy her father would end up being. She didn't have the heart or the money to hire a hitman.

She finishes rubbing the sofa and lifts her hands up off it a bit, and closes her eyes, feeling the tingle from the friction. She loves warm hands. They never last long, unless she's in the sun, in the Summer. When she's outside, in the open, she's never completely calm. 

She wishes she could type with mittens. A car outside revs as it accelerates down the street, and her whole body twitches in a brief panic. She hates that about her body. 

Maevis shouldn't have to live like this - with a mother in a constant state. Maevis can't know that anything at all is the matter, and so, at three years old, she doesn't. Maeve is napping in the small bedroom they share right now - the one with the most comfortable bed in the world. Ani can hear her snoring lightly. Ani had wept the previous night, at the thought of having to leave that bed behind. Maevis almost never sleeps soundly, except in beds too perfect for her mother to afford to take with them.

She wouldn't tell Normand this time that she was moving, until she had finally moved, and was already elsewhere. She wouldn't tell him where that was for at least a few months. The last time she'd moved, her brother had left a good job and burned a better bridge just to help her get the sofa on the car - a favour which turned into him sleeping on it for five months, because he stupidly thought he could snap his fingers at any time, and become a warrior, if he needed to be. He hadn't needed to, which was why she still had a brother.

"I'll be your meat shield, whatever - just keep me fat with beer and pizza", Norm had said with that *I-don't-know-what-the-hell-I'm-promising* smile that he often had, when he thought he knew what he was promising. Ani had known that he hadn't known what he had been promising then. Normand only got strong when he was happy, and Bull didn't make anybody happy, so that wasn't a thing she was going to let Norm promise again.

Her hands are still tingling from the sofa-rub, and she sits herself upright on the magic sofa in a cross-legged position and keeps her eyes closed, while she imagines what her neighbour down the hall would have to say about being called a shithead in an electronic mail sent to the entire condo association (except for maybe Lynda).

She tries to put herself into Lynda's place - tries to imagine living with a guy like Jackson. The sound of his tiring self-pity quietly vibrating through the concrete wall between their condos is too much for Ani at this point. She already has a far, far worse Jackson of her own, and has no more room for any more Jackson. 

Jackson, though, is all bark, and no bite - acted out *or* implied. Ani has cornered Lynda a bunch of times in the laundry room to make damn sure, and Lynda never seems scared or hurt - just pretty disappointed and a bit resigned... and of course, in denial. Like Jackson is the best she can ever expect. 

Jackson likes complaining about every person he meets - except himself - and thinks his life is a chore and his neighbours are stealing his mail and only *his* music is worth hearing through the hallways and dogs are the devil and the military has given them all the Internet so it could spy on everybody, and anybody who doesn't look like him and talk like him is probably up to something. 

He calls everybody bad names, mostly under his breath, but not always. If you give Jackson a particular kind of look, he'll break eye contact. As tiny as Ani is, she thinks she could probably take Jackson down if he had to. Some days, she wouldn't mind trying. She's not worried about Lynda's safety - she's just impatient for Lynda to get on with the rest of her life. She doesn't know Lynda that well. She just knows Jackson Newhouse is still choosing to be a loser.

Jackson Newhouse is the scapegoat Ani needs to get out of her lease. He deserves it anyway. Lynda needs to move on. Somehow, Ani will manage both of their problems at once, in one well-written letter. Somehow. She'll figure it out. She just needs to think. But first, she needs to vent. She downs the rest of her beer and gets back to the desk.

She writes a few drafts of the first paragraph, trying to get the tone right. 

The first draft starts like this:

*Dear Condo Committee,*

*Regarding the loud argument in the stairwell last Friday, and the accusations levelled against me by Mr. Newhouse:*

This is enough of being professional. It's just the first draft. Ani has all afternoon. She keeps typing.

*Insults out of Jackson Newhouse's mouth are like air out of an asshole - they're a lot of rotten noise, and don't mean shit.*

The insult's a bit awkward, and poorly placed, but it does its job for her. She says it out loud a few times, to the computer screen, like she's talking to Jackson Newhouse, and there's lots of people around to hear her finally say what most of them are probably thinking, and Jackson Newhouse can't look Ani in the eye, and he doesn't say anything back:

"Jackson Newhouse, insults out of you - out of your mouth are like - they're like air out of your asshole. They're rotten noise and it doesn't mean shit."

"Words out of your mouth are like insults -"

"Words out of your mouth are like air out of an asshole - they don't mean shit."

"Insults out of your mouth are like - air out of your asshole - they're just rotten noise, really, and they don't mean shit."

She changes the background in her mind, running through the scenario where she says those words - then tougher, tighter versions of them - about Jackson Newhouse, and Jackson never looks Ani in the eye while she's saying this, and he never says shit back to her, and never invades her personal space, and everybody's on Ani's side and backing her up and nodding and a couple are even clapping, because Ani's got bigger balls than Jackson Newhouse. 

She wishes she had a mirror right there, so she could practice looking more bad-ass. She changes the background in her mind, running through the same scenario where she says those words about Jackson Newhouse, and Jackson never looks Ani in the eye and never says shit back to her, and everybody's on Ani's side, because she's got bigger balls than Jackson Newhouse ever will. 

She wishes she had a mirror right there - so she could tell Jackson Newhouse to stop being such a shithead - and look at herself while she's standing up for something, and see a bad-ass that nobody would ever mess with looking right back at her.

Her hands are still a bit warm and not shaking any more, and she's imaging all the set piece scenarios - hallways, dining room tables, office lunch areas, shopping malls, restaurants, deserted islands, space stations - where she's telling Jackson Newhouse to go to hell. 

Because she can't tell Bull to go to hell, any more than she can tell him to just go home, and stay there. She's even said please before. Nothing ever works.

She knows all this vitriol won't make it into her final draft, of course, so continues typing in this vein, down the Dark Path for several more paragraphs, pouring out her soul at the soulless World Wide Web, intellectually eviscerating poor Jackson Newhouse, the ultimate victim and scapegoat, voicing her own anger sideways at the undeserving father of her child, to a condo committee she needs to part ways with quickly. 

The modest speed at which she is able to actually type all of this makes her soon bored of listening to herself slow sputter and fume and smoulder and spin and rage at the state of the world around her. She stops typing for a moment, and just listens to the sound of her daughter Johnny lightly snoring in the next room. She gets a kick out of calling her daughter Johnny. It helps her get her humour back.

Trying to type angry always makes Ani feel better, because she's always been a get-yourself-into-trouble-*speaking*-before-you-think sort of person. Letters are a bit safer, really. That's why she's never taken typing lessons; it's better for her career this way, to type, ponderously.

Ani keeps writing a few more paragraphs from the Dark Side until she'd expunged all of her worst feelings about the man she was really typing about, committing them to the nameless cloud - pressing send after addressing the email to myneighbourjackson @ myneighbourjacksonsucks.com. 

The email bounces, of course, arriving back politely a few moment later, apologizing about not being deliverable, but it makes Ani feel better anyway, to have pressed send on it. It went somewhere; the Universe knows what she meant anyway. She also prints a copy on her old dot-matrix, thinking she might drop it in Jackson's mail slot when she finally moves out, but decides to burn it with a candle instead, next to the tiny open kitchen window, hoping the mood she had been in for the last few days might find its way outside and somehow disappear forever. 

---

Olivia didn't say much that whole time we were getting our stuff set up for that night, just the essential things, like how to light an oil lamp, and which sleeping bag was bigger. Not much else.

I'm sort of used to that. She's always been pretty quiet. That's OK. When she was really young, she would sometimes sing for no reason. Not all the time - just at particular times. Olivia would be quiet for long stretches - maybe days, and then out of nowhere, she'd hum this tune, or sing some words in a string, like she'd been thinking about doing it all that time, and then all the sudden, it was time to do it, and then she'd just do it. You never knew when little Olive would start singing. It didn't matter where she was - she could be in a store, or in the car, or in her bedroom, or at school... there was no telling when she'd stop being really quiet, and suddenly start to sing, and then go back to being quiet again, once she'd got it out there.

It usually didn't last too long, when she did. A few verses, maybe a whole short tune. She always made them up, they were always kind of pretty. I prefer talk radio to listening to music, but I'm always glad to hear any song Olivia might sing. I just stop what I'm doing and listen. She never sings the same one twice. I haven't heard her sing like that for a year though. She's been sad about something, but everybody's been calling it angry. They've got it wrong.

After we got our stuff all sorted out, I got some lemonade into some cups and we sat out on the porch, right next to each other, because the porch isn't big enough for two people to sit too far apart, and we just sat there, and watched the sky and the water and the old, elder apple trees waving around. They'd start to shimmer once the wind picked up. That's what I call it - the Wind Shimmers.

Olivia wasn't saying anything. That's OK. I was just happy sitting there and imaging Olivia and I someday being old ladies together. We were close enough in age, that once we got really old, nobody would even remember who was the older one.

After a while, Olive said,
