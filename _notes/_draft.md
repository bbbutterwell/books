Birds & Bees

Once upon a time, at the tail end of a too-short Winter, there was an old woman sitting on a bank by the ocean - the one which had surrounded her and her home for much of her life, and which she had come to both fear and love in equal measure, as was befitting an old woman regarding the unfathomable oceans, which always were and always would be far greater than her. 

The chill, gentle wind was the tail of this, her last cold season, and it tried in vain to bite at her through her many well-loved layers, but only her rosy cheeks felt it one bit - though more like a kiss, and not cold at all. She loved herself some scarves, and could never wrap up in enough of them these days - they whipped lazily about her face, as she squinted out at the grey and slowly heaving waters of the Bay. She was capped with three hats, overlaid, and then a bundled coat, and boots large enough for all those extra fuzzy socks - all the ones which she could manage to find, and fit on  - and then all those other layers of leggings and ankle-length skirts and worn sweaters and long underwear and other things, above and beneath one another. Not to mention the mittens upon mittens... one might easily imagine all of that, with a warm, old woman inside, I'll wager, on one wonderful Winter morning.

Just being toasty amid the late February chill was all that she really needed now - there was nothing left for her to ask for. She had had herself a commendably good time through the years, though hard ones here and there, and now her reward and rest were close at hand. There was only some handing-off to do, and then it could be truly done, for a good, long time.

The old woman turned awkwardly inside her Winter padded stuffery, as she became aware of another heavily bundled form sitting right there, close beside her. How had the woman not heard this other's approach? How long had she had company, as she had been sitting and gazing out into the Bay, and beyond?

The old woman's companion had every other bit of cold-weather clothing which the old woman had either not been able to fit over or under her own, or otherwise not known she still had at all, back at the house. Her companion was also looking out to the Bay, as the old woman had been, in much the same contented pose. 

Really though, how long had they been there, all that time?

"Maevis, what on Heaven's Earth are you wearing?" asked the old woman, "Are those all my extra scarves? Where did you find those old hats? I thought I had given them all away. That coat is too tattered. Good heavens, you'll catch a death. There's great holes in it. I had it in the sewing room so that I could cut it into ribbons, for projects."

Maeve sat silent for a short moment still gazing out to sea, and then, raising a mitten to her lips, said "*Shhh...* I'm pretending to be an old lady, with you."

The old woman paused, no longer certain what could surprise her anymore, about the young woman. "I see." she said, "Well, alright then."

And so the two bundles of old ladies and clothes sat together for a while, saying nothing, regarding the changing tides, at the tail end of a too-short Winter.

After some time, Maevis spoke again, "We're two pretty damn fine old ladies, aren't we, Beatrice?"

And that is when Bee felt the pang the hardest. It took her breath away, and she couldn't speak for a moment, and finally she answered, "Yes. Yes we are,  Maevis, my Dearest. We are certainly that."

And then, because of that, this is what they both surely, fully became - damn fine old ladies. Each in their own good time.

What's wrong with your eyes, Olive asked me, are you... crying? I didn't think you did that. Mom said you never do that.

I hadn't noticed my eyes had been leaking again. I still hadn't gotten used to that happening yet, so my guard was down. I think Liz had broke something inside me, when she had come over and accidentally showed me how to sob properly. I'm not sure I'd call it broke, I guess, but it was certainly something that got loose. Bad timing. Now I was tearing up in front of Olive and I hadn't even known it. This wasn't good. A person can't just lose control like that.

I wasn't about to make Olive worried, so I lied and said I was just having allergies and wiped my face, and then sniffled, which was fake. We have to get back to the house, I told her, the pizza's going to be ready soon, your parents are probably getting hungry. It's just allergies, don't worry about it. 

Olive's not dumb though, and I don't think she believed me. I'm not so great at telling lies. She didn't say anything more right away though. 

Olive and I had been sitting on the New Old Shed's tiny porch, which is big enough for just two people to sit, and the fox had been dancing around down there in the elder apple trees for a good twenty minutes or so, and I suppose I had been imagining Olive and I someday being old ladies together, because why not? That's not a crime, to imagine that. It would probably happen someday, right? So what's the harm in imaging. If she didn't move away to some other place anyhow - or if she did, at least she could come back when we're both older, so we could be old ladies together for a while. At least for a while. I was just imaging, that's all.

But then I had started to think about Bee, and her last couple of weeks and I hadn't wanted to think about that right now, but that's what happened. I should have known. I didn't notice the tears that escaped - I was still happy about Olive seeing her first fox. It just all snuck up on me.

Crying is kind of confusing, really. You can do it when you're sad, which is what everybody knows and most people can manage, and you can do it when you're happy, which I've heard a lot about and seen a few times, but don't really get. What I'm learning though is that when you're sad and happy at the same time - which is a bit messed up, but it does happen - then that's when you're most likely to start crying. I mean, that's my experience anyway, I don't know about you. Wonderful. Something new to look out for. I didn't want to worry Olive. She's sad too. It's not my turn right now. 

The fox wasn't there anymore - it had hopped away somewhere out of sight. I don't think it had caught anything, just played in the wind for a while. Most of the time that's all it does when I'm watching. I could tell from the sky and the air that it was probably going to rain tonight. Let's go get some pizza, I said and got myself up. Olive said, I'm not dumb you know, I know there's something wrong, and I said yeah I know. I'm hungry, let's go. And then we left our stuff and I put the bug net over the door and we headed back through the trees to the house. I was hoping Norm hadn't forgotten the extra cheese, and he hadn't at all - there was loads of it.

Talk about Bee and birds

Olive asks Maeve why she was born. Maeve senses something stirring, she doesn't want Olive to get spooked. She starts a frank conversation between generations, about big topics. Normand and Claudette hear about this and confront Maeve, but Maeve isn't exactly Olive's parent, and she's not exactly her sister. What are they going to talk about, that matters to both of them?

Bee is who they talk about - and then the elders and the histories and the island, and then what it means to say the future.
