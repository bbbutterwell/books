Birds & Bees

"Be *creative* and *helpful*, both at once. That's the assignment. I'm going for a smoke."

That's what Mr. McReady said, while writing **Helpful + Creative = 97%** on the whiteboard, before turning briefly to the class for any questions, ignoring Edlee Redmond's eagerly raised arm, and walking briskly out the door, with a final, professional nod at his grade 6 class. "Don't forget to enjoy your work. See you all before lunch". Out the door, click. 

Edlee took a moment before lowering his arm, a bit glum. He had had a very good question this time. A real shame everyone in the room hadn't had the chance to hear it.

Mr. Roger McReady had a system. He gave low marks swiftly to anyone who clearly failed to try, and near-perfect marks to anybody who clearly bothered to. There wasn't much in between. 57% or 97% made up about 5/6ths of the marks he handed out. He did sometimes enjoy awarding a 77%, when a student had managed to stymie him on whether they had clearly tried hard enough. 57%, 77%, and 97% made up 100% of the grades Mr. McReady ever granted, for the year-and-a-half he taught at Elders Falls Middle School, before eventually accepting a position somewhere North-West of Yellowknife, presumably taking his system with him, but those are all other stories.

Talk about Bee and birds

Olive asks Maeve why she was born. Maeve senses something stirring, she doesn't want Olive to get spooked. She starts a frank conversation between generations, about big topics. Normand and Claudette hear about this and confront Maeve, but Maeve isn't exactly Olive's parent, and she's not exactly her sister. What are they going to talk about, that matters to both of them?

Bee is who they talk about - and then the elders and the histories and the island, and then what it means to say the future.

When does the Game start? 

- Ani & Normand playing Super Chess

- Maeve meets Niall
