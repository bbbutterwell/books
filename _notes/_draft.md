Once upon a time, at the tail end of a too-short Winter, there was an old woman sitting on a bank by the ocean - the one which had surrounded her and her home for much of her life, and which she had come to both fear and love in equal measure, as was befitting a woman regarding the sea, which always was and would be far greater than she. 

The chill, gentle wind was the tail of this, her last Winter, and it tried in vain to bite at her through her many well-loved layers, but only her rosy cheeks felt it at all - though like a kiss. She loved scarves, and could never wrap herself in enough of them these days - they whipped lazily about her face, as she squinted out at the grey and slowly heaving waters of the Bay. She was capped with three hats, at least, overlaid, and then a bundled coat, and boots large enough for all those extra fuzzy socks - all the ones which she could manage to find, and fit on  - and then all those other layers of pants and long skirts and worn sweaters and long underwear and other things. Not to mention the mittens upon mittens... one can certainly imagine all of that, with a warm, old woman inside, I'm sure.

Just being toasty amid the late Winter chill was all she needed now - there was nothing left for her to ask for. She had had herself a commendably good time, though hard at times, and now her reward and rest was close at hand. There was only some handing-off to do, and then it could be truly done. 

The old woman turned awkwardly inside her winter outfit, as she became aware of another bundled form sitting right there, close beside her. How had the woman not heard the other approach? How long had she had company, as she had been  gazing out into the Bay, and beyond?

The old woman's sitting companion had every other bit of Winter clothing which the old woman had either not been able to add to her own layers, or otherwise not known she still had back at the house. The bundled companion was also looking out to sea, as the old woman had been. 

Really though, how long had they been there, all that time?

"Maevis, what on Heaven's Earth are you wearing?", asked the old woman, "Are those all my extra scarves? Where did you find all those old hats? I thought I had given those all away. That coat is too tattered. You'll catch a death. I had it in the sewing room so that I could cut it into ribbons."

"Shhh..." said Maeve, still staring out at the slowly churning sea, in her calmest way, "I'm pretending to be an old lady with you."

The old woman paused, no longer certain what could surprise her anymore. "I see." she said, "Alright then."

And so the two bundles of old ladies and clothes sat together for a while, saying nothing, regarding the changing tides.

Maeve spoke, "We're two pretty damn fine old ladies, aren't we, Beatrice?"

The last bit of her old heart now broken open, Beatrice said, after a breath, "Yes... yes we are,  Maevis, my dearest. We are certainly that."

And then, because of that, this is what they both surely, fully became, each in their own good time.

What's wrong with your eyes, Olive asked me, are you crying? You never cry. 

I hadn't noticed my eyes had been crying all on their own. I still hadn't gotten used to that happening yet. I think Liz had cracked something inside, when she had come over and accidentally taught me how to sob properly. I'm not sure I'd call it broken, but it was certainly something. Bad timing. Now I was crying right in front of Olive and I hadn't even known it. This wasn't good. A person can't just lose control like that.

I wasn't about to make Olive worried, so I lied and said I was just having allergies. We have to get back to the house, I told her, the pizza's going to be ready soon. It's just allergies, don't worry about it. Olive's not dumb though, so I don't think she believed me. 

She and I had been sitting on the New Old Shed's tiny porch, which is big enough just for two people to sit, and the fox had been dancing around down there in the elder apple trees for a good twenty minutes or something, and I had started to imagine Olive and I as old ladies some day, because why not? It would probably happen someday, so what's the harm in imaging. If she didn't move away to some other place, or if she did, at least she could come back when we're both older, so we could be old ladies together. At least for a while. I was just imaging, that's all.

Then I had started to think about Bee, and her last couple of weeks and I hadn't wanted to think about that, but that's what happened. I should have known. I didn't notice my face getting wet - I was still happy about Olive seeing her first fox. It snuck up on me.

Crying is pretty confusing. You can do it when you're sad, which is what everybody knows and most people can manage, and you can do it when you're happy, which I've heard a lot about but don't really understand. What I'm learning is when you're sad and happy at the same time - which is a bit messed up, but it happens - then that's when you're most likely to start crying. I mean, that's my experience anyway. Wonderful. Something new to look out for. I didn't want to worry Olive. She's sad too, it's not my turn right now.
