"Be *creative* and *helpful*, both at once. That's the assignment. I'm going for a smoke."

That's what Mr. McReady said, while writing **Helpful + Creative = 97%** on the whiteboard, before turning briefly to the class for any questions, ignoring Edlee Redmond's eagerly raised arm, and walking briskly out the door, with a final, professional nod at his grade 6 class. "Don't forget to enjoy your work. See you all before lunch". Out the door, click. 

Edlee took a moment before lowering his arm, a bit glum. He had had a very good question this time. A real shame everyone in the room hadn't had the chance to hear it.

Roger McReady had a system. He gave low marks swiftly to anyone who clearly failed to try, and near-perfect marks to anybody who clearly bothered to. There wasn't much in between. 57% or 97% made up about 5/6ths of the marks he handed out. He did sometimes enjoy awarding a 77%, when a student had managed to stymie him on whether they had clearly tried hard enough. 57%, 77%, and 97% made up 100% of the grades Mr. McReady ever granted, for the year-and-a-half he taught at Elders Falls Middle School, before eventually accepting a position somewhere North-West of Yellowknife, presumably taking his system with him, but those are all other stories.

"Did he mean right now, or at the same time, eventually?"

"Sorry, excuse me?" That's how Niall answers most questions, when the question is from somebody he doesn't know, and so wasn't expecting a question from, at all.

Niall meant, he was sorry that he hadn't met that person yet, and so hadn't;'t been prepared to pay attention to and then recall their question. Niall was from somewhere in England once, but he had been born in Canada more recently. He was reliably sorry for a number of things.

New people, to Niall, needed admittance, first. Otherwise, he couldn't do anything for them, or about them. People moved around him, like obstacles he practiced getting better at avoiding.

"Are we supposed to start the assignment *now*, I mean.", said the classmate on his right, whom he didn't know yet and who had asked him the first question. They were wearing the same t-short that he was.

"You have on my shirt", answered Niall. That had to be cleared up first, otherwise he couldn't proceed to help the classmate with whatever they needed. The fact about the matching t-shirts would consume him.

"What?" The girl on his right said back, changing how her face was. Niall just looked at her, waiting for her to either notice or agree that he was right, about their t-shirts being the same. She seemed to be doing neither, but Niall often never knew these things. People's faces moved too fast sometimes. The girl was speaking again.

Maeve hadn't thought the question had been that hard. It was an A|B question, pretty simple. She looked around at the class of kids, all talking, in the absence of Mr. MacReady, as he went for a smoke. Everything was too loud, she couldn't understand what anybody was doing, now. Were they all doing the assignment? Is that what they were supposed to be doing now? She had thought the question was pretty easy. 

She didn't know how else to ask it, so she just asked the kid next to her again, using the same words. "Did he mean, start the assignment right *now*, or do both parts of it at the same time, later on?" What had the teacher meant by, *be creative and helpful, both at once*? All the other kids were asking each other questions, and giving answers, but Maeve couldn't tell if those things *were* the assignment, or just *about* the assignment. 

The boy was looking at her shirt. Maeve hugged her binder to herself and repeated the question, a third time. "What did he mean by, '*at once*'?"

"I don't know you. We have the same shirt" is all the boy said.

Maeve saw the kid was right about the shirt. Some of the kids around them had pulled out construction paper and started to plan posters and charts. "I'm Maeve. You're Niall, right?"

The boy nodded. "I'm Niall".

"I like your shirt."

"It's good. It's a good shirt."

"I have the same one."

No response. Niall knew there had been a question. What did Maeve want? He looked at her binder, which was now blocking her shirt. She had drawn monsters all over it, in coloured marker. A lot of them had horns and teeth, that's how he knew.

"Niall."

Niall seemed to be thinking.

"Niall. Hey, I don't know what's going on, here."

Niall didn't seem to either. Its was hard to tell what he knew, right then.

"I'm going to go find Mr. MacReady" Maeve said, "I don't know what's going on."

Maeve dropped all her pencils into a graphite-smeared pencil case and dropped it into her pack, slinging on on her shoulder. She stood up and looked at Niall, who was still trying to remember what she had asked him "Are you coming?"

Niall said, "What?", hoping she'd repeat her first question. He wanted to give her the right answer.

"I'm leaving the classroom." Maeve clarified, "I have to find Mr. MacReady, because I don't understand the assignment. I need to understand the assignment." Maeve's meds made that mandatory - she needed to understand the assignment. Maeve walked out of the room, and eventually Niall followed, once he recalled that she must have been his assignment partner, since their desks were together. He didn't really know what was going on either.

Out in the Library Hall - which was the hallway that led to the Library, past a few hundred lockers, two bathrooms, two janitorial closets, a staircase, and seven classrooms - Maeve had stopped to look around for Mr. MacReady. She really didn't know anything about the school's floorpan. She had been in a very heads-down kind of headspace the last couple of weeks. Off the bus, into the first classroom, to the library, to the bathroom, to the cafeteria, back to the second classroom, back on the bus. Few variations thrown in. She knew the route between the classrooms and the bathrooms and the library. She knew the Library Hall. Other corridors went elsewhere. There was apparently a gymnasium, a shop, and a theatre. These were all backstories to Maeve, at the beginning of grade 7. Where was Mr. MacReady? He wasn't in the Library Hall.

Talk about Bee and birds

Olive asks Maeve why she was born. Maeve senses something stirring, she doesn't want Olive to get spooked. She starts a frank conversation between generations, about big topics. Normand and Claudette hear about this and confront Maeve, but Maeve isn't exactly Olive's parent, and she's not exactly her sister. What are they going to talk about, that matters to both of them?

Bee is who they talk about - and then the elders and the histories and the island, and then what it means to say the future.

When does the Game start? 

- Ani & Normand playing Super Chess

- Maeve meets Niall

- Gnome story #1

- Maeve and Bee's first talk
