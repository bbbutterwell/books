CFGH-FM (101.01, *The Falls!*) is a my favourite radio station. Before my thirteenth birthday, I had heard *about* radio, and I had heard lots of radio. We had a car now and then while I was growing up, and cars have radios. You ignore them after a while, if you're like me. They're too loud and the people on them talk weird. If a person near me started talking to me like people on the radio talk, I'd walk away from them. I don't think I could help it.

But CFGH-FM - I like that radio station. I started listening to it on my thirteenth birthday, because I was so bored and sad that I ended up fixing an old radio. That's how sad and bored I was. You might not know this, but I didn't know how to fix anything before my thirteenth birthday. Really, nothing. I don't need to exaggerate, and why would I? Not a handy person. 

But by the end of my thirteenth birthday, I had fixed a god-damned radio. The first sounds that came out of my new old radio that wasn't static, were the voices of Jillian Peeks and Lewis Vale, radio personalities. They were talking about climate change. I almost changed the channel - this again, is what I remember thinking. I didn't want to hear it. I didn't want to hear that I chose to be born just so that I could watch the world slide into the ocean, so all the Morgans and everybody else could end up at the bottom of the sea together, going oops, we broke the planet. 

There should be a law about what you say around kids, about how little hope you've left them to work with. I said something like this to Bee, once. She started acting a bit strangely after that. I'm not sure how to explain it. It woke her up. I don't know what had put her to sleep.

But I didn't change the channel. The only other radio channel we get in Elders Falls anyway is full of music and ads they don't change them much and nobody I know listens to that channel, and I forget its callsign. It's got an X in it, that's all I remember. I just listen to *The Falls* (CFGH-FM, 101.01). I know I've said that enough times now. Clearly, I'm plugging it. 

But I didn't change the channel, even though they were talking about my least favourite subject, Climate Change.

I don't know why I kept listening. It was something in Jillian's voice. Lewis was being the doom-sayer, as they say. That's what he does. He's really good at it, but he doesn't believe that things are so bad, he's just really good at saying they are. He's the Devil's Advocate. He does this so Jillian can tell him he's wrong - he's wrong about things being hopeless, and people being mean, and only caring about money, and war being inevitable, and that we'll never fix things and never stoop fighting and never get to Mars and learn how to make it up to all the animals we've harmed in the making of this movie about Humans trying to Human. 

Jillian tells Lewis he's wrong, and he listens, and he complains, and he says but, and no, I hear you, it's just that, and he brings on experts and quotes the Internet and in the end he has to concede that  Jillian might have a fair a point, he'll admit. At the end of every episode, he thanks us all for listening and he thanks his co-host, Dr. Jillian Peeks, and he makes a point to slightly stress the Dr. part, because she's got four degrees and has climbed the second-tallest mountain in the world, twice, knows five languages, and has been in low Earth's orbit, and she doesn't even mention any of this on her website, so he does, which she honestly hates. I love both of them for their own reasons. 

I couldn't change the channel, while they were discussing climate change and Lewis was being pessimistic and Jillian was being level-headed and thinking sideways, and the two of them changed my mind about how old I might end up managing to be someday, and what I might feel about that. They did that in the second half of the first episode I ever listened to. The show is called Elders Calls, which I still think is a really dumb name for a radio show, but I get it. It's a call-in show, and you already know how we name things here.
