## Uncles & Mothers

*version 0505*

I went back and found Claudette in the kitchen. She was trying to get cell phone service for some reason, which made no sense, and I told her that I found Olive and she was fine but she wasn't going back to school that week, and Claudette was about to tell me that oh no, I was wrong about that, and then I said, Hey. Claudette. I'm serious here. I made a promise. Olivia's staying with me this week. If she doesn't do her homework even once, unless there's a good reason, then you can take her back. We'll watch *Fraggle Rock* and eat ice cream and do homework. I'll make her clean the house. I've got lots of jobs I'm not doing that need doing anyway. That's what I said to Claudette, while she listened.

I think Claudette just really needed to sit down and have a think about everything - maybe something about how I said all of that made her not want to argue anyway. Either way, she just sat down at the table and rubbed her forehead hard, and muttered in French, and I don't speak French that well, so I just said that I was going to go tell Norm now, and she nodded and so I grabbed my ice cream from the fridge and hobbled all the Jeebus way down Driveway Road to the dock and ate ice cream right out of the tub. I could have taken Norm's car but it takes the same amount of time to walk, once you account for finding the keys and things. That's about how long Driveway Road is.

I met a crow walking up toward the house from the other way, on the right - they always seem to show up at sort of inconvenient times - and we kind of looked at each other while we passed, and that's a whole other thing that's been going on around here for a while now, and I'll tell you about it some other time, probably. The crows don't ever fly on Sisters Island, did you know that? They walk. It's not that common to see, because they don't visit often, but sometimes I see one walking around, or walking by, or whatever. Never in the trees. They usually look at me, sometimes like, *Hey*. Sometimes I think one might even raise a wing at me sometime, but I haven't seen one do that yet. Sometimes they look like they just might though. Anyway, I'll tell you about all that some other time. I have a few Crow stories. One even has a Gnome in it.

I got to the dock and Norm was walking around doing nothing and I guess I can imagine how it might feel to not know where your eleven-year old was, after they've just run off, so I didn't waste any time with suspense, and I told him that I found her and she's OK and he said well where'd she go? And I said she was staying with me for the week, and that I found her in the blueberries where I knew she'd be, and she wasn't going back with them today, because she's staying with me, because I need help, because I almost broke my leg, because of you. That's kind of what I said to Norm.

I'm not the best at reading people's faces, but his face did a couple of things, but then he didn't really say anything, so I just said OK and started to hobble back to the house, and almost fell, but Normand caught me and we walked together on the way back up.

We didn't see that Crow coming back, and Norm said thanks for finding The Olive, again, and I said well, you know, any time.

---

I was getting pretty hungry by the time the whole runaway kid emergency was over, so I told Claudette and Norm to wait in the house and I'd go talk to Olive for a while, because she and I hadn't seen each other in a bit anyway. Claudette gave me a little hug and Norm said he was going to check the main attic from the inside this time, to figure out where the birds definitely were. That seemed like a reasonable plan. I figured they could just hang out in the house and talk to each other, or not, or whatever. 

I just didn't want to deal with anybody, I'd almost had enough adult visits by then, if you want to know the truth. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good *Fraggle Rock* marathon, but there's a reason I'm still living on an island. Nobody's forcing me to, after all. It's an island, and there's usually just me and the scritters here, and that's usually just what I like. 

So I said to them, hang out here, I'm going to go for a walk with Olive, and we'll be back at dinner, around five. You make some pizza, I want extra cheese. 

I found Olivia still waiting for me, standing in middle of the blueberry bushes like she didn't know what to do with herself, and she had picked a whole handful of blueberries, and seemed to be waiting for instructions, and I had been gone almost twenty-seven minutes, which was about what I had thought. I had brought a shoulder bag made out of old jeans filled with bags of potato chips, some lemonades, two sleeping bags, four pillows, a roll of toilet paper, matches for playing with, both spyglasses, my radio, and a big flashlight you can hang on things. 

Olivia told me right then that I had to tell her parents she definitely wasn't going back with them, but I wasn't having any of that - I said, no, you tell them yourself, and be nice about it, or else. I told her she and I were going to stay in the New Old Shed that night and watch the moon or the rain, and the lighthouse and the town, and maybe look for the fox run through the orchard, like he didn't know we were watching him, but we were going to have pizza with her parents before that at the house a little later, and she was going to tell them she was sorry for running off, and then after dinner, they were going home, and leaving her with me. The tide would be down again by then. Then Olive and I would have the island to ourselves and the scritters, for the whole week.

She was getting ready to get really mad about the apology part, but I told her to switch it right off - I wasn't in the mood. My foot was killing me, and my best friend had just told me that I had let her down bad, and I needed my cousin to grow up a bit, just for a few days. I didn't know what else to say. I needed an adult, but she could step up instead. I need you to step-up, Olive. That's what I said. We're going to spend the week together, taking care of Bee's house, together. She's watching us. She wants you to say you're sorry to Norm and Claudette. You can fake it. I said all of that to Olivia, while she listened. Then I handed her the big jean bag of things, because I wasn't carrying it any further. It was too hard with the crutch and all.

I guess I was having a weird day - everything I said was shutting people up. I don't usually manage to do that, maybe it had something to do with the Crow I saw, or the Tylenol, I don't know. It hadn't been a normal week. It's not like I've never fallen off of something, or never almost broken something, but I don't know what I was feeling. There was something new happening. It's still happening now. 

I told Olive to follow me, and she did, with the big jean bag full of things, and eating her blueberries that she'd picked. We walked through the woods a few hundred yards to the New Old shed, to get it ready for a wicked awesome sleepover. She'd been there only once before, which wasn't enough.

Olive seemed OK, overall though - I think it started sinking in that she wasn't going back to school for the whole week. I wasn't going to mention all the work I had planned for her right then, I figured she just needed a night off too, like her parents did. 

Sometimes I feel that Bee's still around. Sometimes the things I do remind me of Bee, a little bit, for example. Not really though, that's the weird thing. Bee wasn't always great with kids, but I'm kind of pretty good with them most of the time, for some reason. I think Liz was right. I don't like bragging though. But I felt Bee had something to do with it too - this whole day that happened. I've been thinking a lot lately about how much she taught me, and how she's still teaching me, because I'm still thinking about her all the time.

Olive didn't love finding out the shed didn't have any electricity in it. She knew that already from before, I thought, but I guess she hadn't paid attention the other time she had been there. That was the time she was eight, and had wanted to leave pretty bad, because she saw two spiders. I remember that. A small one and a smaller one. I have no time for that stuff,  about needing electricity everywhere and not wanting to ever see a spider, even once. Normand thinks she got that from Claudette, but Claudette's not so bad outdoors. Normand says I didn't know Claudette when she was younger, and I guess he's right.

Olive didn't know how good she had it, with no electricity for a few hours, and sharing a shed with just a few small spiders, but she would know, by the week's end. That's what Bee would manage to do anyway, if she were here, and Olive happened to be me. That's what was going to happen. 

So the sun was high and the weather was already getting cool when we got to the top of the orchard where the New Old Shed is, and I knew we might get some wind and rain that night, from having heard it on the radio earlier, and I was hoping that might happen. Because I hadn't seen Olivia camping outdoors or anything close to that before, and especially not in the rain, with the wind whacking against the side of a shed, like it can, and I guess I just really wanted her to have that. I wanted to watch her figure out what she thought about being a little person on a big, windy island. I wanted to watch her watch that first fox. I wanted to see her taste potato chips under a full moon, listening to rain on a thin roof, or otherwise, a thousand crickets singing the song of their people. I wanted to see her breathing peacefully in a big sleeping bag, in a thunder storm, and without a door, or a care in the world. I was so selfish, excited for her, I can't even tell you. 

For a few moments, I even almost thought that maybe falling off the roof and losing my best friend for maybe forever but maybe not was what I needed that week. Can you imagine that?. I really don't know why some things happen sometimes.

So we set up our stuff - Olivia chose the loft for her sleeping bag, and what kid wouldn't? I couldn't really fit up there properly anymore, all that well, especially with the brace, so that was fine with me. I wasn't going to take that from her anyway, taking the loft. That's for kids first.

And we laid out our chip bags in order of how we figured we'd finish them off, and our lemonades, which would get warm, I warned her, but she didn't seem to mind so much, and we got our pillows all sorted, and I found the pencils and the pen and paper and puzzles, and put them all in a pile on the table, in case they were needed at all, and I said that we had a bug net for the door, and we didn't need the real door, which was a work table now, out on the side of the shed. Olive asked, well what about animals? What if they get in at us? And I said, they know never to come in here, and she said why, and I said, because I come out here now and then and pee around the shed, so they know who's boss here, and that grossed her out, of course, but it's the truth, so there you go. That works with the scritters here, anyway. I don't know about other places' scritters. I might not have much say about birds living in our attics, but all the animals here know who owns the sheds. I own most of them, and the Spirit's got the other one, for now.

While we were setting up, I was still trying to figure out that whole time, what the week was going to be like, in my head. I hadn't really planned on looking after a kid for five or six whole days when I woke up that morning, so I was still processing what had happened, and what we both needed to happen next. Olive had something she was going through, and I did too, so, we'll see. I didn't want to complicate things. I decided I wouldn't worry, and instead, we'd just sleep in the shed that night and listen to whatever the weather was going to do, and be OK with whichever scritters showed up, and then we'd let Olive take the lead from there, the next morning, rain or shine. I think she needs something even more than I do. I'll figure out what it is. I know all the hiding places.

The day Normand Angus Morgan met his twin's daughter for the first time, she was eleven hours old, and the father was gone - disappeared when he'd learned the news. Ani had had an early, rough delivery and things had been touch and go. He'd driven his hatchback all night to get to the hospital, and when the worst was over, and they'd let him in to see her, Ani said hi from her bed, through a fog of meds, and held the baby out to him, and said, "Well, there you go. Look what I went and got myself into now. What are you gonna do?"

His plans to head Up North were out the window. His sister had a daughter, and that daughter had no dad. What was he going to do?

Norm took off his jacket, with the shiny studs and scary skulls, and took the baby, and the kid was crying, and he didn't know how to hold babies, except he had heard about their necks being weak, so he held her head and he tried to imagine being in some oil field somewhere making gobs of money while that baby was somewhere else, growing up without a dad, and he couldn't manage to do it. His imagination rarely failed him, but this time, it wasn't showing up. He didn't even know where Up North was right then. What was he going to do?

"Hello" he said, not sure what more to say. He was holding a wrinkled, little alien. It was frowning at him, with its eyes closed shut, like it was already disappointed in the job he was doing, and just couldn't bear to look anymore. It had no weight at all to it, like holding a balled-up blanket, with a disapproving, wrinkled little face. "What's its name?"

"Her name is Maevis Beatrice."

He looked at his sister, who met his look, and he said, "Maevis..."

"She'll make it her own, Norm."

"If you say so. Are you sure?"

"That's what I say. And yes."

"Ok, then. Hello... Maevis Beatrice. I'm Normand."

The little, shut-eyed alien frowned even more. This was not the father, and they had been told there would be one present. This had been made clear. They would need their mother and father if they were going to succeed at their mission. Of course, to babies, these thoughts are altogether quite a bit lumpier than they might sound in adult minds, with all that specificity, but still. It was not a cause for big smiles at the moment.

The not-father felt safe though, otherwise, and so, in that moment, began the baby's lifelong process of grappling with the complexities of being sent to Earth on a mission of great significance, in the body and mind and destiny of a human being. It had been so cut and dry in the briefing. There had been no warning that deviations and complications were even possible, much less, imminent. It was like they had been... tricked.

"I don't think she likes me." Norm noted, as the baby began to squirm and grimace.

Ani yawned, "Well I've told her all about you already, so what do you expect?"

Normand didn't tell Ani to shut up or call her a dumb-ass - he just wanted to know this little thing wasn't disappointed with him already. He really needed to not disappoint her. He hadn't expected to really need that, right then. Where had it come from? Why was this baby frowning so damn hard?

The baby, being one, was incredibly malleable in that moment. It had already heard that it was a *she*, and it would hear that again and again, on many occasions, though at the moment couldn't say at all what it might mean. What did it mean, to be called a *she*? What *was* all of this? There was sound everywhere, and something else, as well. Other strange input. Itchiness, tugging sensations in places it hadn't known it had, novel forces at work, and all that breathable gas that had rushed in, and all the rest that had been expelled, and was still being expelled, and the flipping and folding up and patting and poking... it was nearly intolerable at times, and what in any event was *Maevis Beatrice*? And more importantly still, where had the *mother* gone? It had been assured there would be a *mother*. It began to wail, in search of its birthright, it was already forgetting the instructions, but luckily, it had been given instincts, which seemed a poor substitute.

It would not let go though, if its need to know that it had a mission. Give it instincts if those were a must, and called it a her, if it mattered so... but she would not forget that she was here for a reason, and her mother needed to be made aware.

Normand, a bit wide-eyed, tried to hand the baby back, but Ani put up her hands "I'm on break now. I nearly died." She looked tired. She was, in truth, beyond tired, but also happier than she had been in a long time; Normand knew how to hold a baby. She had no clue that would be a thing. He had been wearing his faded Empire Strikes Back t-shirt under that stupid jacket, and it didn't quite go with the piercings either, or any of it, with that curious, terrified expression on his face now. What a mess of a new uncle he was. What was he worried about anyway? They'd all be Ok. "Use the Force, Norm. I need to sleep pretty hard. I'll be back, I promise.", and then she'd rolled over and away from them both.

And the nurses shrugged and smiled and said they'd be back to check in a bit, and to have a seat, maybe. And he sat as they left, and the little alien kept squealing in fits and spurts, in protest of whatever, and Ani abandoned him by falling asleep immediately, in spite of the noise, and he just sat there bounced the little thing and silently asked the Force to send Maevis Beatrice Morgan the dad she deserved.
