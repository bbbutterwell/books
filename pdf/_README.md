Thank you for acquiring and extracting this zip file, which contains twelve draft chapters and a prologue, which is the beginning of the story *Witches & Knights & Unicorn Fights*. 

You can find it on **GitHub** [here](https://github.com/bbbutterwell/book).

You can read it on **Royal Road** [here](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/53291/witches-knights-unicorn-fights).

You can support it on **Patreon** [here](https://www.patreon.com/bbbutterwell).

There is no chapter numbered 12. Do not fear, this is intentional. I'll explain later, maybe. 

Eventually, I will learn how to produce a nice PDF with a title and table of contents and page numbering and all of the chapters in it, all at once, and in order. For now, you get the raw deal.

PDF updates will be released with both new chapters and fixes to existing ones, as opportunity permits. 

This story is released under a Creative Commons license, which encourages its sharing, printing, and general enjoyment by all. Just don't claim it as your own work. Not *yet*, anyway.

I hope you enjoy it.
