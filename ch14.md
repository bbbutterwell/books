## How to Approach

*updated 2022-06-03*

Ani Esther Morgan considers how to begin this latest letter, which she intends to send by electronic mail to the condo committee just before the weekend, when she and Maevis will be far away in a family campground, cooking up their last hot dogs and making up games with Monopoly money.

The committee will send somebody to knock, knock, knock on their door, but nobody will be there to open it and argue about anything. Ani will leave a note on the kitchen table, that reads, *Ellen, stop using your key for non-emergencies. This is still our home.*

The World Wide Web has only been around for a few short years, but Ani thinks she's already made all the electronic mail mistakes a person can ever make, at least once. So she leaves out the recipient addresses until the end, this time, so she won't accidentally hit the send button before the letter has had all of her very worst ideas edited out, all of its typos thoroughly removed, and the recipient list carefully considered and re-considered. She will do this last part very soberly.

She starts with her subject. It reads:

**Regarding our shithead neighbour, Jackson Newhouse**

It feels good to finally get *that* off her chest, through her fingers, to somebody else, somewhere. Her computer now knows how she feels. That's how it feels to her. It has no soul, of course (as far as she can tell), but since her computer is now connected to the World Wide Web, she believes some computer somewhere in the world - maybe the most powerful one, maybe in Russia - now also knows how she feels today, and will remember, and will understand, in its own way. Maybe many computers around the world will someday know.

Then she changes the subject line to:

**Regarding our neighbour, Jackson Newhouse, the shithead**

She tries changing the *the* to an *a*, to see whether that feels more or less accurate, if she were being completely honest:

**Regarding our neighbour, Jackson Newhouse, a shithead**

That doesn't seem to make it any better, somehow. Then:

**Regarding Jackson Newhouse, our shithead neighbour**

She wonders for a while whether either or both the words *Shithead* and *Neighbour* should be capitalized, in this case.

She shortens the Regarding to just Re:

**Re: Jackson Newhouse, our shithead neighbour**

Then Ani recalls that this will make people think the epithet has originated from somebody else other than her, and that she's simply weighing in on the matter, and she certainly doesn't want to to leave that impression. She's the one who thinks Jackson is a shithead, with a capital S. She changes the Re: momentarily to "About" (with and without the colon), and plays with the case:

**About: Jackson Newhouse, our Shithead neighbour**

**About Jackson Newhouse, our Shithead Neighbour**

She rests her elbows on the desk, her chin on her interlocked, hands to keep them from shaking quite so much. She stares at the screen. Among the intricate tattoos swirling around her wrists and down along her arms, a cartoon bear bear peeks out of some beautiful flowers, and smiles approvingly at her work so far. The Bear, whom Maevis calls BooBear, always approves of whatever Ani chooses to aim him at. BooBear is a He. Maevis got to choose.

Her electronic mail program has been helpfully pointing out all this time that *shithead* is not a proper word. Ani hasn't found the setting yet that will allow her to make it one, and BooBear clearly doesn't mind.

She concludes that "Regarding" (and *with* a colon) is more professional - and also, first words and proper names are the only things worth capitalizing, in most cases - and so decides to stick with that, and then give things a moment to settle:

**Regarding: Jackson Newhouse, our shithead neighbour.**

She's not sure about ending electronic mail subject lines with periods, but it feels right, so she does.

She cracks open a beer, swings herself off her desk chair, and drops herself onto the old sofa right next to the desk, sat at a right angle to it (the only way all three furnitures could be made to fit down here), letting the small subject line fume silently in the middle of her monitor, while she sits and drinks.

She takes a long one. She imagines possible repercussions and accusations and escalations and whether there were likely to be any actual resolutions in any of this. She wanted a resolution.

This has been the first condo she has ever rented, and it will be the last one, as well. She's already decided this. She still doesn't know how condo associations work, with regards to complaints, with regards to neighbours behaving poorly. She knows every association is just a bunch of people, after all, and people come in all kinds and sizes. That's all she knows about that. 

The afternoon light filtering through the eight-hundred dollar blinds which she doesn't own evenly illuminates the small, sparse living room with the unnecessarily sunken floor that has barely enough room for her small, cheap computer desk, the large glass coffee table which isn't hers and she isn't allowed to get rid of, and the old sofa which is the only piece of furniture she ever takes with her when she and Maevis are finally forced to move.

It's the sofa Maevis was conceived on. Ani likes to tell visitors this, to make them uncomfortable after they've sat down on it, until she clarifies what she means. 

What she means is, she had a clear vision one evening, while smoking a big joint alone upon that very sofa: a clear vision of having herself a daughter. She had never had a single notion of being a mother until that moment, but in that moment, as high as she was, it all made perfect sense. Of course she was meant to have a daughter. It was important. She wasn't sure how, but it was. This vision came to Ani Morgan two years before Maevis was born, to the day.

Finding the father to assist her with realizing her vision was an altogether different story, which occurred somewhat later, and more than somewhat unfortunately.

The sofa feels like sitting on burlap, but it's even tougher and much kinder than leather, and has every possible colour in it - and somehow still looks beautiful despite these things, all in together. And all of that, to Ani, makes it a magic sofa, and not one to ever get left behind. And so Maevis and she never had left it behind. It was part of their family.

The magic sofa always travelled with them, strapped to the top of whatever beat-up old vehicle was carrying within its belly all of their clothes, and themselves, and their other personal items, and then whatever animals had signed on to accompany the two Morgans on their here-and-back-again journeys between the Out West, the Down South, and the Back East.

This old, beautiful, magic sofa had seen more states and more provinces combined than any other sofa in the world, in Ani's estimation. Maevis had taken her first big fall off of a sofa, from this very sofa. Its arms are scratched thin by treasured cats now passed on, or fled for parts unknown, or reluctantly relinquished. Pennies will fall from it with curious timing, when Ani and Maevis think there could be nowhere left inside it for any pennies to hide. Never dimes, or nickels, or quarters - and only a pair of toonies once, back when those were still sort of new. That was that time when Ani had run out of bus tickets, and would have been fired, had it not been for two toonies fallen from Heaven, through their beautiful, magic sofa. There was no scientific explanation for it. It wasn't necessary.

Ani starts rubbing the solid, thick sofa cushions on either side of her quickly, to build up some friction in her palms, which warm them up, and help her feel energized, so that she can think straight. She has to get this letter right. The right words will mean getting out of her lease a month early, which she needs to do, without forfeiting the deposit. She needs all of that to afford a new used car, gas, meds, and food to head Down South again.

Bull had found her number, and left his usual message on the answering machine, even though the machine's leave-a-message message has the voice of an old, former neighbour, who is an army vet, telling the caller in a gravelly, war-hardened tone to call back later - if they had to - or leave a message - if it was actually urgent.

Still, the voice message left on her machine that Tuesday had known who would really be listening anyway. Bull's voice never sounds urgent. Just pure, dead calm.

*Princess. You can't stop a father seeing his kid forever. You know it's not right. I have a right to see my son. I just want to talk. I want to see my son for a while. I'm in your town now. I've got money, we can take him out for a burger. Or a salad, whatever. Your call. I'll call back.*

Click.

Ani rubs her palms against the old, colourful cushions, furiously.

Bull thinks Ani eats salads all the time. She almost never eats salads. She just doesn't eat meat. She's no vegan, for sure - she loves fish too much. To eat them, that is. Not as companions. Not ironically. Fish would eat her, given the chance, so she feels that's fair, as fair goes.

Bull thinks anything that doesn't have a cow or a pig in it is a salad. He also thinks their child is a boy. Ani had made sure to lie about that, so he'd at least be looking for a boy, and not Maeve - if he ever managed to find her school, before Ani could manage to have the nightmare that would warn her that he was about to. 

Maevis Morgan's official name on her birth certificate is Johnny. Johnny B. Morgan.

Bull is not a man deterred by restraining orders. He has a preternatural way of getting around things like that. He is connected, in some way, Ani knows that much. She had sensed that connection about Bull when they first met - at the time, she had thought that this meant *they* had a connection, but that wasn't what she had felt at all, as it turned out. She was a bit younger then, and read things wrong a lot more than she does now.

She had been too late to make the right decisions differently, about Maevis, and about the kind of guy her father would end up being. She didn't have the heart or the money to hire a hitman.

She finishes rubbing the sofa and lifts her hands up off it a bit, and closes her eyes, feeling the tingle in her palms from the friction. She loves warmed hands. They never last long, unless she's in the sun, in the Summer. When she's outside, in the open, she's never completely calm.

She wishes she could type with mittens. A car outside revs as it accelerates down the street, and her whole body twitches in a brief panic. She hates that about her body.

Maevis shouldn't have to live like this - with a mother in a constant state. Maevis can't know that anything at all is the matter, and so, at three years old, she still doesn't. Maeve is napping in the small bedroom they share, with Dooley curled up around her head, like a dog hat, like he always makes himself into when Maeve finally settles and sleeps for a while.

The bed they share in this tiny condo is the most comfortable bed in the world. Ani can hear Maeve snoring lightly. Ani had wept the previous night, in the bathroom, at the thought of having to leave that bed behind. Maevis almost never sleeps soundly, except, apparently, in beds too perfect for her mother to afford to take with them.

She wouldn't tell Normand this time that she was moving, until she had finally moved, and was already elsewhere. She wouldn't tell him where that was either, for at least a few months. The last time she'd moved, her brother had left a good job and burned a better bridge just to help her get the sofa on the car - a favour which turned into him sleeping on it for five months, because he stupidly thought he could snap his fingers at any time, and become a warrior, if she needed him to be. He hadn't needed to, because she hadn't needed him to, which was why Ani still had a brother. She needed him more to just be around.

*I'll be your meat shield, whatever - just keep me fat with beer and pizza*, Norm had said with that *I-don't-know-what-the-hell-I'm-promising* smile that he had sometimes, when he thought he knew what he was promising. Ani had known then that he hadn't known at all what he was promising. Normand only got strength when he was happy, and Bull didn't make anybody happy, so that wasn't a thing she was going to let Norm promise, ever again.

Her hands are still tingling from the cushion-rub, and she sits herself upright on the magic sofa in a cross-legged position and keeps her eyes closed, while she imagines what her neighbour down the hall would have to say about being called a shithead in an electronic mail sent to the entire condo association (except for maybe Lynda).

She tries to put herself into Lynda's place again - tries to imagine living with a guy like Jackson. The sound of his tiring self-pity quietly vibrating through the concrete wall between their condos is too much for Ani at this point. She already has a far, far worse Jackson of her own, and just has no more room for any more Jackson.

Jackson, though, is all bark, and no bite - acted out, or implied. Ani has cornered Lynda a bunch of times in the laundry room to make damn sure, and Lynda is never scared or hurt - just pretty disappointed and a bit resigned... and of course, still in denial. Like Jackson is the best Jackson she can find. Like she needs a Jackson at all.

Jackson likes complaining about every person he meets - except himself - and thinks his life is a chore and his neighbours are stealing his mail and only his music is worth hearing through the hallways and cats and dogs are the devil and the military has given them all the Internet so it can spy on everybody, and anybody who doesn't look like him and talk like him is probably up to something, and the police should be called.

He calls everybody bad names, mostly under his breath, but not always. If you give Jackson a *particular* kind of look, he'll break eye contact pretty quick. As tiny as Ani is, she thinks she could probably take Jackson down if he had to. Some days, she really wouldn't mind giving it a go. She's not worried about Lynda's safety - she's just impatient for Lynda to get on with the rest of her life. She doesn't even know Lynda that well. She just knows Jackson Newhouse is still choosing to be a loser.

Jackson Newhouse is the scapegoat Ani needs to get out of her lease. He deserves it anyway. Lynda needs to move on. Somehow, Ani will manage both of their problems at once, in one well-written letter. Somehow. She'll figure it out. She just needs to think.

But first, she needs to vent. She downs the rest of her beer and gets back to the desk.

She writes a few drafts of the first paragraph, trying to get the tone right. 

The first draft starts like this:

*Dear Condo Committee,*

*Regarding the loud argument in the stairwell last Friday, and the false and unkind accusations levelled against me by Mr. Newhouse:*

This is enough of being professional. It's just the first draft. Ani has all afternoon. She keeps typing.

*Frankly, insults and accusations out of Jackson Newhouse's mouth are like so much air out of an asshole - they're a lot of rotten noise, and none of it means shit.*

The insult's a bit long and awkward, and poorly placed - Ani's never been as good as she'd like to be with insults - but it does its job for her in the moment. She says it out loud a few times, to the computer screen, like she's talking right to Jackson Newhouse, and there's lots of people around to hear her finally say what most of them are probably thinking, and Jackson can't look Ani in the eye, and he doesn't say anything back:

"Jackson Newhouse, insults out of you - out of your mouth are like - they're like air out of your asshole. You're rotten noise and it doesn't mean shit."

"Words out of your mouth are like accusations and -"

"Words out of your mouth are like air out of an asshole - they don't mean shit."

"Insults and accusations out of your mouth are like... air out of your asshole - they're just rotten noise, really, and they don't mean shit. You shithead."

She changes the background in her mind, running through the scenario where she says those words - then tougher, tighter versions of them - about Jackson Newhouse, and Jackson never looks Ani in the eye while she's saying this, in her scenarios, and he never says *shit* back to her, and never invades her personal space once, or makes her feel afraid, and everybody's on Ani's side and backing her up and nodding and a couple are even clapping, and one has a pitchfork now... because Ani's got bigger balls than Jackson Newhouse.

She wishes she had a mirror right there, so she could practice looking more bad-ass. She changes the background in her mind, over and over, running through the same scenario where she says those words about Jackson Newhouse. And Jackson never looks Ani in the eye and never says shit back to her - and everybody's on Ani's side, because she's got bigger balls than Jackson Newhouse ever will.

She wishes she had a mirror. So she could tell Jackson Newhouse to stop being such a scary shithead - and look at herself while she's standing up for something important, and see a bad-ass that nobody would ever mess with, looking right back at her.

She keeps practicing being brave and angry and fed-the-fuck up.

Her hands are still a bit warm and not shaking any more, and she's imaging all these set-piece scenarios for her stand-off with Jackson Newhouse - hallways, dining room tables, office lunch areas, shopping malls, restaurants, cruise ships, deserted islands, space stations - where she's telling Jackson Newhouse to go to hell.

Because she can't tell *Bull* to go to hell, any more than she can tell him to just go home, and stay there. She even said please once. Bull doesn't know about please. He finds the idea amusing.

She knows all this vitriol won't make it into her final draft, of course, so continues typing in this vein, down the Dark Path for several more paragraphs, pouring out her soul at the soulless World Wide Web, intellectually eviscerating poor Jackson Newhouse, the ultimate victim and scapegoat, voicing her own anger sideways at the undeserving father of her child, to a condo committee she needs to part ways with really fast.

The modest speed at which she is able to actually type all of this makes her soon bored of watching herself slowly sputter and fume and smoulder and spin and rage at the state of the world around her, backing up occasionally to fix unintentional spelling errors, which she can't stand. They always break her train of thought, and rage.

She stops typing for a moment, and just listens to the sound of her daughter Johnny lightly snoring in the next room. She gets a kick out of calling her daughter Johnny sometimes, to herself. It helps her get some of the humour back.

Trying to type angry always makes Ani feel better, eventually, because she's always been a get-yourself-into-trouble-*speaking*-before-you-think sort of person. Letters are a bit safer, really. That's why she's never taken typing lessons; it's better for her career this way - to type, ponderously.

Ani keeps writing a few more paragraphs from the Dark Side until she'd expunged all of her worst feelings about the man she was really typing about, committing them to the unfathomable Internet - pressing Send after addressing the email to myneighbourjackson @ myneighbourjacksonsucks.com.

The email bounces, of course, arriving back politely a moment later, apologizing about not knowing where to deliver itself to, but it makes Ani feel better anyway, to have pressed Send on it.

Her feelings went somewhere; the Universe knows what she means anyway. She also prints a copy on her old dot-matrix, thinking she might drop it in Jackson's mail slot when she finally moves out, but decides to burn it with a candle instead, next to the tiny open kitchen window, hoping the mood she had been in for the last few months might find its way outside and somehow disappear forever, never to be found again.

Olivia didn't say much that whole time we were getting our stuff set up for that night, in the New Old Shed - just the essential stuff, like asking how to light an oil lamp, and which sleeping bag was bigger. She wasn't sure, even after I showed her. Not much else was said.

I'm sort of used to that, with Olive. She's always been pretty quiet. That's OK. When she was younger, she would often sometimes sing for no reason. Not all the time - just at particular times. Olivia would be quiet for long stretches - maybe days - and then out of nowhere, she'd hum this tune, or sing some words in a string, like she'd been thinking about doing it all that time that she had been quiet, and then all the sudden, it was time to do it, and then she'd just do it.

You never knew when little Olive would start singing. It didn't matter where she was - she could be in a store, or in the car, or in her bedroom, or at school... there was no telling when she'd stop being really quiet, and suddenly start to sing, and then go back to being quiet again, once she'd got it out there.

It usually didn't last too long, when she did. A few verses, maybe a whole short tune. She always made them up, they were always kind of pretty. I prefer talk radio to listening to music most of the time now, but I'm always glad to hear any song Olivia might want to sing. I just stop what I'm doing and listen. She never sings the same one twice. I haven't heard her sing like that for a year though. She's been sad about something, but everybody's been calling it angry. They've got it wrong.

Pizza we be ready in a couple of hours, back at the house. After we got our stuff all sorted out, I got some lemonade into some cups and we sat out on the porch, right next to each other, because the porch isn't big enough for two people to sit too far apart, and we just sat there, watching as the sun started coming down again toward the sea, and watched the sky and the water and the old, elder apple trees waving around. They'd start to shimmer once the wind picked up. That's what I call it - the Wind Shimmers. By leg was feeling a bit better. I might take my cast off soon.

I said to Olive, maybe we'd see the fox. It liked to run around in the apple trees when the wind picked up, near dusk. Sometimes it caught a mouse, and sometimes it would chase a Gnome. Olive snuffed at that. Everybody was used to be talking about Gnomes - they all thought it was a running joke I wouldn't let go of. Like I was practicing being deadpan. Like I would do that for years and years. Whatever. I remember when Olive believed in Gnomes just like Harry does now. She invented the Gnome Gnet, actually. Well, we did it together, in the Shop Shed. It's one of Bently's old fishing nets, with streamers attached. The streamers are supposed to confuse the Gnomes so they're easier to catch. I had said, good idea Olive, and I had meant it. It was.

The fox had never caught a Gnome either. You might not Gnow get how quick Gnomes can be. They don't look quick, but they're really quick. I know I haven't told you any stories about them yet - too much other stuff's been going on. I guess I have a full life. Sometimes I forget.

Now Olive's suddenly too cool to believe in Gnomes anymore. Whatever, I've never needed to be cool. I'll keep believing in Gnomes till the cows come home. I don't care about what's cool.

Olivia wasn't saying anything, after snuffing about the Gnomes. That's OK. I was just happy sitting there and imaging she and I someday being old ladies together, sitting just like that, like I knew we would. We were close enough in age, that once we got really old, nobody would even remember who was the older one. I wasn't in a hurry to grow up, but I also kind of couldn't wait to get old, all the same.

After a while, Olive said I don't want to go back to school, and I shrugged and said OK. But I wasn't in charge of that. She knew that. She knew that I knew that she didn't want to go back to school. Message received. I didn't ask why. I was trying a thing.

And the fox was leaping through the grass down in the orchard, all through the elder Apples - Olive made a small sound, oh, and I didn't dare say or do anything else at all. Neither of us said anything more - I just sat, and let the fox and Olive have their time, and the wind began to shimmer.

Ani pulls into the condo parking lot with the Morgan's latest wheels - an old, orange station wagon, and parks it in the guest spot. It's 10pm in the evening. She doesn't want to meet anybody or talk to anybody, she's had a hard couple of days. Maeve's been a beast. She fled twice into the trees, once toward the campground entrance, once under the snack bar. Her meds ran out. The money ran out. The gas nearly ran out. Maeve's out if the car, Dooley's running after her, half-following, half trying to wrangle her before she runs into traffic. Dooley's had a stressful few days; Maevis, his human sister, has had a stressful few days. Maevis Morgan doesn't like camping.

"MAEVIS!" Ani shouts, a reflex from when the girl was a year younger and almost got herself run over one too many times, running headlong through parking lots. Ani's out of the car, like a pro, and Dooley's circling around Maeve's legs, sending her sidelong into the bushes, trying to turn it into playtime, and barking like mad. Somebody needs to help his human with their child. He doesn't know who to bark at for that.

"DOOLEY! STOP!" Ani reaches her daughter and grabs her arm before Maeve climbs stupid again. The lights will be coming on in the condos any second, she doesn't want a scene, but of course this is when she'll get a big one.

"LET ME GOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo! STOP HURTING ME!" Maeve screams, using her Outdoor Voice - her new thing is yelling STOP HURTING ME, because she's discovered this makes Ani's hand loosen just enough for her to slip away - not this time though. Her mother's a quick learner, just like Maeve.

Ani hisses, trying somehow for it to sound motherly and calm, with the remaining nerve she has left - "Maevis Beatrice Morgan you stop yelling right - "

"STOOOOOPPPPPPPPPP!"

"*Right now or -*" but Abi has no *or* that works, once the meds run out. She doesn't agree with meds. They have no life at all without them, these days. They cost too much. A light comes on in Lynda's apartment. Great.

"NO!" Maeve hollers, twisting her arm around in Ani's hand, grabbing at her mother's fingers. Dooley has decided to trying licking her face to make it better. Ani's hauling Maeve as gently as a person can do that back toward the car - fuck it, she's not doing this here. She'll drive around all night until her daughter burns herself out, she doesn't care anymore. They can't plan anything together. "Dooley, get off Maeve, come ON."

"NOOOOooooOOOOOooOOoOOooo!!!! STOPPPPP!" Maeve is done with being told where to go and where to sit and how long and when to not talk loud and she misses her bed and why were they sleeping in a tent now where everybody is loud and why are they going back to the car she just wants her home, she just wants her home, she just wants her home. Where is her home, where.

"*Shut up! Stop making so much noise!*" Jackson's voice yells from the second-floor unit, right next to the one Ani had just wanted to sneak back into without a giant scene, and now can't, and frankly doesn't want to any more. If the sofa were on the car already, she probably wouldn't have even come back. She just wanted the damn sofa.

Dooley's running around in front of the car door, trying to figure out how humans open these things, but he's learning his world is made for beings with arms like humans, and not mouths and paws like he has. It's taken him a while to figure out he's different - it helps to see other dogs and cats now and then, and live with a few too... People are different, and they make most of the world for them. All he can do is scratch at the car paint. *I'm trying to help! I can't open the door!*

"Dooley! *Enough!*" Ani manages to loud-talk this rather than yell, and she'll save all her crying for later when Maeve is maybe asleep - she doesn't know - and right now she just needs to get the keys in the car door and manage to slink away. They'll sleep in the car, their camping trip has been extended. It will be a funny story, in some distant future, when things are better.

She helps her screaming, wriggling child into the car and locks the back doors - the only features she ever needs in a vehicle is child-locking doors and some storage space - and Maeves kicks in vain at the front seat like a caged demon and Ani has long ago said fuck seatbelts, they'll never stay on, and she lets Dooley pile into the back seat where he starts to try and play-wrestle Maeve into some kind of submission, and Ani screams FUCK FUCK FUCK inside her head, turns the key, revs the engine, and slowly, angrily, carefully, does NOT peel out of the parking lot. She does NOT drive full-tilt down the road, praying against hope to see Bull walking down some sidewalk, looking for his son, so she can run the bastard the fuck over, twice.

She doesn't do this. She turns on the stereo, slams on old cassette in, and laugh-cries as she drives away, listening to a chipper Jeff Lynne singing *Mister Blue Sky*, through one of the darkest nights of her life, screaming, kicking, laughing child behind her, and toward some as-yet-to-happen perfect morning light.
